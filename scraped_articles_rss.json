The mayor of Salford, Paul Dennett, described the move as the right and moral thing to do.\n\nAluminium cladding with a plastic core is thought to have contributed to the Grenfell fire spreading through the 24-storey building.\n\n\n\nThe announcement came as Camden council evacuated about 650 households from four tower blocks after fire safety experts said they were unable to guarantee residents\u2019 safety.\n\nPeople living on Chalcots estate were told to leave late on Friday night and offered temporary accommodation in a local leisure centre and nearby hotels. The move prompted confusion and anger among residents, some of whom said they only heard the call to evacuate after it was reported by national media.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday morning, Georgia Gould, the leader of Camden council, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a huge effort overnight to evacuate people.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had everyone, council staff, volunteers, different councillors, all coming together with the fire service to move people safely out of their accommodation.\u201d\n\nThe fire at Grenfell is thought to have started after a Hotpoint fridge-freezer went up in flames. Tests are being carried out to determine whether any specific models need to be recalled.\n\nOn Friday, police said they believed that the blaze had spread so fast because of the cladding of aluminium composite tiles and insulation behind it.\n\n\n\nDet Supt Fiona McCormack, who is overseeing the criminal investigation for the Metropolitan police, said anyone found to be responsible could face manslaughter charges. She said police could not say whether the law had been broken, but were \u201clooking at every criminal offence from manslaughter onwards\u201d.\n\nShe said no one had yet been questioned, but documents and other material had been seized from a number of organisations.\n\nCelotex, which manufactured the insulation used in the \u00a38.6m Grenfell refurbishment, said the material would no longer be supplied for use in cladding. The company announced that it would stop supply \u201cwith immediate effect, including in respect of ongoing projects pending further clarity\u201d.\n\nSince the offence of corporate manslaughter was introduced in 2007, 19 companies have been charged, according to figures from the Crown Prosecution Service. Of those cases, 15 resulted in a guilty verdict with fines of up to \u00a3700,000.\n\nThe Grenfell disaster has provoked a fierce political row over the state of Britain\u2019s housing stock, with campaigners claiming social housing has been neglected in favour of developments marketed at wealthy buyers.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the Conservatives\u2019 attitude to social housing contributed to the disaster, adding that she believed \u201chundreds of people\u201d had died.\n\n\u201cGrenfell house [sic] is not just an accident. Grenfell house is not just an unfortunate incident. Those hundreds of people that died is a direct consequence of Tory attitudes in social housing,\u201d she told a Labour Progress group conference.\n\n\u201cThe Tories think people in social housing are second-class citizens. And as we have seen from Grenfell house, they are offering them second-class standards of safety. So, a direct consequence of that. A direct consequence of outsourcing ... and a direct consequence of deregulation.\u201d\n\nSpeaking after the event, Abbott said: \u201cI think we are going to find that the numbers of people that have died will be in triple figures, just because it\u2019s a 23-storey [sic] block.\u201d The building has 24 storeys.\n\nAbbott said people in government needed to answer questions about why they did not implement recommendations made after previous fires."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 07:47:47 GMT", "title": "Hundreds evacuated from London tower blocks over fears of Grenfell repeat", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/23/camden-to-evacuate-taplow-tower-over-fire-safety-fears-after-grenfell-disaster", "text": "Chalcots estate residents moved overnight into temporary accommodation after council said it could not guarantee safety\n\nHundreds of residents of a housing estate in north London have been evacuated overnight after fire inspectors said five tower blocks were at risk following the Grenfell Tower blaze.\n\nPeople living on Chalcots estate in Swiss Cottage were woken during the night and told to leave their homes immediately after Camden council became the first in the country to order an evacuation of blocks at risk of a similar fire.\n\nCladding on 27 tower blocks fails fire safety tests Read more\n\nThose affected described scenes of confusion as they were told the council was unable to guarantee residents\u2019 safety, They are asked to find alternative accommodation or report to a local leisure centre, where hundreds of mattresses had been laid out.

I have been with them all night and people are distressed, angry and scared. It\u2019s such a difficult decision.\n\n\u201cBut I said to fire services, is there anything I can do to make this block safe tonight? I offered to pay for fire services to be stationed outside those blocks just so we could have a couple of days to get the works done, but the message was [that there was] nothing to do to make blocks safe that night.\u201d\n\nGould had announced the evacuation after a review of the blocks found cladding similar to that which had been on Grenfell Tower, as well as fire risks on insulation surrounding gas piping.\n\n\u201cAll we care about is getting people to safety.

Within the hour, however, Gould said the decision had been taken to evacuate the whole estate.\n\nShe said a rest centre for residents had been set up at Swiss Cottage library and efforts by council staff to process residents\u2019 cases there were beginning immediately.\n\n'Why did they wait for people to die?'

Pets are also welcome at both rest centres and hotel accommodation.\u201d\n\nThe council earlier said it would immediately start preparing to remove cladding from five towers on the estate after an inspection ordered following the Grenfell disaster, which killed at least 79 people, found it could be a fire risk.\n\nGould said residents had since shared fire safety concerns that she had not previously been aware of and experts who inspected the estate on Friday informed her they could not guarantee the tenants\u2019 safety.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe realise that this is hugely distressing for everyone affected and we will be doing all we can, alongside London fire brigade and other authorities, to support our residents at this difficult time.

Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP\n\nOn Thursday, the council said its safety inspection found that while the cladding and insulation were different from that used on Grenfell Tower, the former \u201cdid not satisfy our independent laboratory testing or the high standards we set for contractors\u201d. In a letter sent to residents, the council said it was taking legal advice.\n\nCamden council said officials had been knocking on doors one block at a time for safety reasons, starting at Taplow, then working through Burnham, Bray, Blashford and Dorney, from about 8pm on Friday.\n\nA spokesman said residents would be allowed back at the weekend to collect their possessions under fire brigade escort. It is believed that some may not be able to return permanently for up to four weeks.\n\nThe evacuation came as four more Grenfell Tower victims were formally identified, bringing the total to nine. Scotland Yard said detectives were keeping open the option of bringing manslaughter charges relating to the fire.\n\n\n\nRefurbishment on Chalcots estate was overseen by Rydon, the company involved in the refit of Grenfell Tower, according to its website.\n\n\n\nA statement released by Downing Street on behalf of Theresa May said: \u201cMy thoughts are with residents being evacuated in Camden while their homes are made safe tonight. We will work with and support the emergency services and relevant authorities to safeguard the public.\u201d\n\nTulip Siddiq, the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, the constituency in which Chalcots is located, said the council decision was the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cIf you think someone\u2019s in danger, especially in light of Grenfell, you take the first decision, even if it\u2019s not ideal. Off the back of the meeting we had last night, in which lots of residents raised concerns, Camden council and London fire brigade did the right thing, which was to carry out the safety checks,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOnce they\u2019d checked out the internal machinery, they decided that the buildings are not fit for purpose. So they\u2019ve made a decision that couldn\u2019t have been easy for the council, to rehouse the 800 households that we have. It may seem dramatic to some people, but if you are in a position of responsibility then I think it\u2019s the right decision to make.\u201d"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 09:14:02 GMT", "title": "Andrea Leadsom's call for 'patrotic' Brexit coverage prompts anger", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/24/andrea-leadsom-patriotic-brexit-coverage-newsnight-eu-negotiations", "text": "House of Commons leader called \u2018stupid\u2019 for suggesting broadcasters should be \u2018a bit patriotic\u2019 about negotiations with the EU\n\nAndrea Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, has come under fire for calling on broadcasters to be \u201ca bit patriotic\u201d in their Brexit coverage.\n\nThe outgoing Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, described Leadsom, who stood for the leadership of the Conservative party last year, as \u201csinister\u201d for her comments on the BBC\u2019s Newsnight.\n\nLeadsom said: \u201cIt would be helpful if broadcasters were willing to be a bit patriotic.

Trump himself told a press conference in late July: \u201cThey probably have her [Hillary Clinton\u2019s] 33,000 emails. I hope they do. They probably have her 33,000 emails that she lost and deleted because you\u2019d see some beauties there.\u201d\n\nThe following month, according to the Post, an envelope with \u201ceyes only\u201d instructions was sent by courier from the CIA to the White House. Only Obama and three senior aides were permitted to see it. \u201cInside was an intelligence bombshell, a report drawn from sourcing deep inside the Russian government that detailed Russian president Vladimir Putin\u2019s direct involvement in a cyber campaign to disrupt and discredit the US presidential race,\u201d the paper says.\n\nPutin had given specific instructions, the CIA report added, aimed at defeating or at least damaging Clinton and boosting Trump. The Post says the CIA package came with instructions that it be returned immediately after it was read, and meetings in the situation room followed the same protocols as planning sessions for the raid that killed Osama bin Laden to avoid leaks.\n\nIn August, the paper reports, Obama confronted Putin directly, accompanied only be interpreters, at a meeting of world leaders in China. A senior aide tells the Post that Obama told Putin \u201cwe knew what he was doing and [he] better stop or else\u201d. Putin demanded proof.\n\nAccording to the Post account, over the next five months the administration debated numerous ways to respond, ranging from cyberattacks on Russian infrastructure to the publication of material gathered by the CIA that might embarrass Putin to potentially crippling sanctions that officials said could \u201ccrater\u201d the Russian economy.\n\nBut eventually, some time after Trump\u2019s stunning election win, Obama settled on \u201ca modest package\u201d combining measures that had been drawn up to punish Russia for other issues with economic sanctions \u201cso narrowly targeted that even those who helped design them describe their impact as largely symbolic\u201d.\n\nThe Post adds: \u201cObama also approved a previously undisclosed covert measure that authorised planting cyber weapons in Russia\u2019s infrastructure, the digital equivalent of bombs that could be detonated if the United States found itself in an escalating exchange with Moscow. The project, which Obama approved in a covert-action finding, was still in its planning stages when Obama left office. It would be up to President Trump to decide whether to use the capability.\u201d\n\nOn 7 October, meanwhile, the White House issued a delicately worded statement saying that the US intelligence community was \u201cconfident\u201d that the Russian government was behind the hack of the DNC. But just an hour later, revelations broke of a video tape in which Trump boasted about groping women, quickly followed by a WikiLeaks dump of emails hacked from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The media\u2019s attention focused elsewhere.\n\nTrump\u2019s alleged ties to Russia have received so much attention, including investigations by a special counsel and two congressional committees, that the adequacy of the Obama administration\u2019s response has largely escaped scrutiny.\n\nTrump admits for first time 'I am being investigated' over James Comey's firing Read more\n\nObama and his senior advisers were concerned that any pre-election response could trigger an escalation from Putin, including a cyberattack on voting systems before and on election day, the Post writes. There were also concerns that any action would be interpreted as politically motivated on behalf of Obama\u2019s fellow Democrat Clinton, potentially fuelling Trump\u2019s repeated claims on the campaign trail that the election would be rigged.\n\nDenis McDonough, who was Obama\u2019s chief of staff, defended the administration\u2019s actions. \u201cWe set out from a first-order principle that required us to defend the integrity of the vote,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cImportantly, we did that. It\u2019s also important to establish what happened and what they attempted to do so as to ensure that we take the steps necessary to stop it from happening again.\u201d\n\nBut others in the administration suggest that more could have been done. A former senior official involved in White House deliberations on Russia, who was not named by the Post, is quoted as saying: \u201cIt is the hardest thing about my entire time in government to defend. I feel like we sort of choked.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThe punishment did not fit the crime,\u201d the former ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, said of the US sanctions.\n\nDaniel Drezner, a professor of International Politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the story underscored what was \u201calways Obama\u2019s greatest weakness as a foreign policy president\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo his credit he was always wary [to] first do no harm, which led him to not react immediately to crises and not necessarily want to take retaliatory action,\u201d Drezner said. \u201cBut this is a case where he clearly moved too slowly, and I think failed to appreciate the magnitude of what was going on.\u201d\n\nWhile Drezner said there was validity to the administration\u2019s concern of appearing partial to Clinton, and of acting in a way that might cast scrutiny over the legitimacy of her presidency had she won, Obama could nonetheless have announced some countermeasures against Russia at an earlier stage aimed at limiting Moscow\u2019s aggression.\n\nHe also laid blame on Republicans, such as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, for reportedly questioning the intelligence presented to them providing evidence of Russian interference in the election.\n\n\u201cI think 15-20 years ago, the very fact that this intrusion had taken place would have generated significant political blowback,\u201d Drezner said.\n\n\u201cBut conservatives and Trump supporters viewed Russia as an ally, rather than an actor intruding on American sovereignty. And that\u2019s on us, that\u2019s not on Russia.\u201d\n\nSign up for the Minute email.

Far from being teased at school, the only hassle I got was endless requests to try on my new specs. My father looked at me with suspicion. Had I faked the blindness, he asked, just so I could look like Harry Potter?\n\nWith my cropped hair and glasses, I did look like a tiny girl Harry. And while the similarity was not deliberate, I did nothing to avoid it, either. The Potter books were the great pop cultural event of my generation (I was born in 1991). In between Game Boys and Pok\u00e9mon, kids began reading again. My school librarian, both confused by and exasperated with Pottermania, dealt with fights over the school\u2019s few tatty copies by imposing a new rule: Potter books could be borrowed for only three days, instead of the week every other title was allowed.\n\nIn the 20 years since the first book arrived on shelves, publishers and parents have been asking what alchemy has made JK Rowling\u2019s series so loved. But even if we could quantify the appeal, it would ruin the magic. It is better instead to look at the impact they have had on their readers. Yes, the books were about a boy wizard taking on a dark and powerful villain, but they were also about love trumping hate, about justice and perseverance; in the words of Albus Dumbledore, choosing \u201cbetween what is easy and what is right\u201d. Rowling\u2019s entire cast of magical misfits \u2013 from bookish Hermione to oddball Luna Lovegood, to late bloomer Neville Longbottom \u2013 were all people we wanted to be.\n\nI grew up with Harry (in the final book, he is 17 and so was I), and together we became opinionated children, stroppy teens and world-weary young adults. When the seventh and final book came out in 2007, I read for 12 hours without a break and cried as I finished. I felt something akin to grief; the end of Harry\u2019s story signalled the end of my childhood. I was suddenly adrift. Meanwhile, my now Potter-mad father hovered impatiently nearby, waiting for the appropriate moment to snatch the book off his sobbing daughter.\n\nPotter really did shape my generation. As a cohort who grew up mostly in peacetime, many of the ideas we found in these books were ones we had never encountered before. The wizarding world\u2019s terrible treatment of non-human beings, such as the enslaved house-elves, was the first depiction of slavery I encountered. I learned about Voldemort\u2019s genocidal pursuit of a pure-blood race long before teachers deemed it suitable for me to learn about South African apartheid or Nazi party policies. The treatment of Harry\u2019s teacher Remus Lupin, a werewolf who hides his condition at work, is a metaphor for the stigma surrounding HIV/Aids (a detail confirmed by Rowling herself). We learned about oppression, media bias and the dangers of political apathy in the face of terror for the first time in the pages of Rowling\u2019s books.\n\nAnd all this may have real-world consequences. A 2014 study found that teenagers who identified with Harry displayed more tolerance towards refugees, immigrants and LGBTQ people. In 2016, another study found that Harry Potter readers were less likely to vote for the then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, even after controlling for other factors such as party affiliation, age, gender and education. Is it possible that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s popularity among the young had anything to do with their literary education? Is it possible that Harry, in the 20 years he has been with us, has inspired a generation to be more empathic, welcoming and socially liberal than those before it? We will see. If not, at least my glasses are still cool.\n\nSian Cain is editor of the Guardian\u2019s books site.\n\n\u2018I run Heroine Training for young women\u2019\n\nXandra Robinson-Burns, 25, personal development trainer\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Xandra Robinson-Burns as Professor Minerva McGonagall, at home in Edinburgh. Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian\n\nWhen I was eight, my family moved from Ohio to Virginia, and a friend gave me the first Harry Potter book as a going-away present. It gave me this amazing distraction during what would have otherwise been a difficult experience.\n\nI think, for my generation, Harry Potter is about optimism; belief that you can be your full magical self, in a community of people who are doing the same. Rowling captured the experience of adolescence so vividly, while also building this fantastical world.\n\nGrowing up, I struggled with depression. Once I started to identify what it was, I found all these connections with Harry Potter. I see the Dementors as a really good example of what depression is, this terrible thing that affects everybody to a degree; but some are more sensitive to it than others, and everyone needs some defence.\n\nThere are small but subtly important moments of feminism in Harry Potter\n\nWhen I discovered self-help books around the age of 18, I thought, \u201cI already learned this through Harry Potter.\u201d I wanted to teach people how to identify the lessons in literature. I now live in Edinburgh, where I started a business for young women: Heroine Training. I run Harry Potter-inspired courses, such as a workshop called Hogwarts And The Heroine\u2019s Journey, and Lumos Your Life, which looks at what each of the four Hogwarts houses can bring you in certain situations. I think there are some small but subtly important moments of feminism in Harry Potter: Molly Weasley, for example, is a stay-at-home mum but everyone\u2019s terrified of her, and in the Battle of Hogwarts, she proves she\u2019s a badass.\n\nIn 2007, I did a summer programme in Oxford studying fantasy literature. I was there for the release of the final book, and a few of the teachers delivered it to us in our rooms at midnight. I found out on my birthday that I\u2019d won a Harry Potter trivia contest I\u2019d entered in a bookshop. My prize was a wand: it felt like a message from Dumbledore himself.\n\n\u2018We had a Harry Potter-themed wedding\u2019\n\nLewis Byrom, 36, financial client consultant, and Cassie Byrom, 32, media account manager\n\nLewis I\u2019d planned my proposal to Cassie, who is really into Potter, for about six months. We\u2019d been to Universal Studios in Orlando and saw that Diagon Alley (an attraction at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter) was opening a year later, so I knew I wanted to take her back for her 30th. I had the ring on me, and I got a girl to take a photograph of us.\n\nI got down on one knee, and by the time I\u2019d finished, there was a big crowd of people cheering and high-fiving. The manager came over and walked us to the Escape From Gringotts ride. He stopped the ride and let us go on it on our own.\n\nA lot of our friends and family thought Lewis and I were bonkers to do a themed wedding\n\nWe had a Harry Potter-themed wedding. We didn\u2019t want it to look like a kids\u2019 party, so we watched the films with a pad and pen, looking for ideas that we could replicate on our budget. It would have cost a fortune to have Dementors flying around, for example, but we could make 130 wands, and we could make \u201cpotions\u201d if we got old-looking labels and filled glass jars with bubble bath and shampoo. In the end, it looked so good that the staff at the venue were arguing over who got to work that shift.\n\nCassie A lot of our friends and family thought Lewis and I were bonkers to do a themed wedding, but they were excited to see how it was going to turn out. We bought a few of the artefacts, such as the Deluminator (a device to put out lights, used by Dumbledore) and Tom Riddle\u2019s diary (a blank book in which he hid part of his soul); the rest we made ourselves. We went round car-boot sales and charity shops looking for candlesticks and old-looking books, and I made the flowers out of Harry Potter book pages.\n\nWe got married in November, and as soon as we posted the photographs online, they spread everywhere. I had hundreds of messages and friend requests on Instagram and Facebook, from people all over the world. Sometimes we\u2019d see a comment such as, \u201cMust be nice to have a rich mum and dad.\u201d But we did it all ourselves and I\u2019m quite proud of that.\n\n\u2018It was my first identification with nerd culture as a positive thing\u2019\n\nIndia Block, 25, journalist\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest India Block as Nymphadora Tonks. Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian\n\nI lived in Hong Kong until I was about five. The books were being released just as I moved to the UK, so I don\u2019t know an England without Harry Potter. I didn\u2019t get into it until the third book. I remember reading the fourth in the playground with my friend, both of us reading separate pages with our necks cricked. My dad was in the army, so we moved around a lot, but Harry Potter was a constant. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve gone anywhere in the world and not met someone who\u2019s into it.\n\nIt was my first identification with nerd culture as a positive thing. It\u2019s quite inclusive, of women especially. It\u2019s not really shameful for people my age to be fans, but my dad thinks it\u2019s ridiculous. I share a Kindle library with him, so I downloaded the Robert Galbraith books (also by Rowling) and he really got into them. When he Googled to see when the next one was coming out, he was like, \u201cYou tricked me into reading JK Rowling!\u201d\n\nThe books aren\u2019t escapist in the sense that you\u2019re pretending nothing else is going on; it\u2019s more like a lens through which a lot of people have engaged with social justice issues. We\u2019re a generation that came into such an uncertain world; we were told that if we studied hard and went to university, we could have everything our parents\u2019 generation had. I\u2019m now a property editor. I spend all day writing about house prices and how it\u2019s not necessarily going to turn out the way we hoped. We joke, \u201cI feel like Harry Potter, because my room is the size of a cupboard!\u201d What I like about the way Rowling wrote is that magic isn\u2019t a solution: you can\u2019t magic more money (the Weasleys are still poor), you can\u2019t magic more food, and you can\u2019t magic yourself a house. For everything magic solves, it throws up another problem.\n\n\u2018Harry celebrates people who\u2019ve been oppressed\u2019\n\nEleanor Spencer-Regan, 31, lecturer, and Martin Richardson, 65, associate professor, both at Durham University\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Martin Richardson as Mad-Eye Moody and Eleanor Spencer-Regan as Narcissa Malfoy, at Durham Cathedral, which was used as a location in the first two Potter films. Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian\n\nEleanor I remember being 14 and crying with a friend because we couldn\u2019t go to Hogwarts, because it either wasn\u2019t real or we hadn\u2019t received our letters. I was 11 when Harry was 11 and 12 when he was 12; by the time the fourth book came out, we were slightly older than him. I can remember queueing with eight-year-olds outside Waterstones for the final book, and feeling unashamed, thinking, \u201cYou weren\u2019t even born when the first book came out \u2013 out of my way!\u201d\n\nIn school, all my friends had pictures of Orlando Bloom on the inside of their lockers and I had a picture of Snape. If I\u2019m lecturing on Potter (I\u2019m an English literature tutor), I\u2019ll still get emotional. I think it slightly bemuses my students.\n\nLast month, at the Durham Pride parade, there was a girl, who must have been about 12, carrying a beautifully painted sign that read, \u201cIf Harry Potter taught us anything, it\u2019s that nobody should have to live in a closet.\u201d We were there to celebrate people who\u2019ve been oppressed, historically, and that\u2019s what Harry\u2019s doing a lot of the time.\n\nIf I\u2019m lecturing on Potter, I\u2019ll still get emotional. I think it bemuses my students\n\nIn so much of children\u2019s literature, characters are either good or bad, and their actions are what make them good or bad. With Harry Potter, it is a lot more nuanced: some people do awful things, but they\u2019re not necessarily awful people; some people have bad things happen to them and there\u2019s no rhyme or reason. Life is complicated.\n\nI felt utterly bereft when it ended. I often comment to my husband that I\u2019d like to develop a specific form of amnesia where I remember everything but the Harry Potter series, so I could have that discovery all over again.\n\nNow I work at Durham University, where many of the films were shot, so I kind of went to Hogwarts in the end. Had my 14-year-old self known that one day I\u2019d be getting into my academic robes in McGonagall\u2019s transfiguration classroom, or talking about Harry Potter for money, I think she\u2019d have been happy.\n\nMartin I was writing a book about the history of education in which I referenced Tom Brown\u2019s Schooldays, and some of my postgrads said Harry Potter was similar. I bought the first five books and a DVD, and I was blown away.\n\nI came up with some lectures (Harry Potter As A Good Citizen, and Harry Potter And Britishness) and, with some tinkering, a Harry Potter module got approved at Durham University. I called the emails to the students \u201cowls\u201d. I wrote, \u201cAn owl will tap on your computer screen at midnight to reveal the location of the opening lecture for Harry Potter and the Age of Illusion.\u201d\n\nWithin two hours, it had been leaked to the BBC that there was to be a sorting ceremony in the Great Hall of Durham Castle. Of course, it went ape. They called it a \u201cHarry Potter course\u201d, when it\u2019s actually only a module; by the time word got to the US, it was a \u201cdegree\u201d. The BBC, Sky and ITN wanted to film it, but the university wouldn\u2019t let anyone in. There was a lot of security; the students had to get through three checkpoints staffed by gowned prefects.\n\nAt the sorting ceremonies, I cover the tables with satin sheets in the house colours. The students wear a sorting hat and are sorted into houses by choosing coloured marbles. Throughout the year, they get points to win the house cup. I give a mini-lecture: are you sorted at birth? Does it matter which family you belong to, or where you live? Does it matter which school you go to? The students are so enthusiastic, they put an enormous amount of effort into their essays.\n\n\u2018In the middle of the night, I\u2019d turn to a box of books I kept by my bed\u2019\n\nMegan Myer, 22, student\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Megan Myer as Luna Lovegood, at home in Sheffield. Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian\n\nMy dad read the books to me before I was five, then we started reading them together. After the first couple of books, I read them on my own and it sparked a love of reading. Now I reread the entire series every summer as a treat to myself; I study English literature, so throughout the year, I read books I either don\u2019t want to read or books that take up a lot of time. Harry Potter is my comfort.\n\nWhen I was eight, we moved to Northern Ireland. That was a tumultuous time, settling in halfway through primary school in (sort of) another country. When I was finding it hard to make friends, I could always go and find my own world. From about the age of 13, I went through a bad period of mental health. When I was up in the middle of the night, finding things really difficult, I\u2019d turn to a box of books I kept by my bed. When everything is so heightened and you feel you can\u2019t relate to anyone and no one understands, having a whole set of characters you can see going through their own troubles is important.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve always found inspiring is not just the books, but the author\n\nWhat I\u2019ve always found inspiring is not just the books, but the author, the way JK Rowling turned such a hard period of her life into something positive that influenced so many other people. You see that real experience of pain in the way she writes about things such as grief. It\u2019s not someone talking down to children. When my grandfather died, I quoted from Harry Potter at the funeral: \u201cAfter all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.\u201d\n\nWhen I was younger, my favourite character would definitely have been Hermione because, being really bookish myself, she was the one I most identified with.\n\nBut now I\u2019d definitely say Luna Lovegood is my favourite: she\u2019s quirky, she\u2019s open-minded, she\u2019s so confident in who she is \u2013 that\u2019s who I aspire to be.\n\n\u2018Dumbledore was a kind of father figure\u2019\n\nNina Khatwa, studio coordinator at Pinewood Studios, and Shivraj Singh, management consultant, both 27\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nina Khatwa as Hermione Granger and Shivraj Singh as Ron Weasley, in Slough. Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian\n\nNina My parents bought my sister the first three books for Christmas; she never got round to reading them, so I kind of stole them. Every time I read them, I feel young and happy. I\u2019ve probably read them 15 times, sometimes in reverse order.\n\nShiv and I met at school in Slough, and we\u2019d talk about Harry Potter a lot. It was the only thing we really had to talk about at the time. He\u2019d try to discuss theories with me. I always thought I was a bigger fan, so I was maybe humouring him when I spoke about it. When the series ended, I felt really down and a bit empty. I think it captured so many people\u2019s imaginations, because it\u2019s not set in an unfamiliar world: it\u2019s England, but there are still so many fantastic things going on.\n\nMy favourite characters are Hermione, because she likes to read and study, and I\u2019ve always been a massive geek; and Dumbledore, because he kind of represents a father figure and I didn\u2019t have a proper relationship with my own dad. My parents split and he wasn\u2019t very present. When you\u2019re younger and you read about a character like that, one you feel could protect you, it\u2019s comforting.\n\nShivraj I remember going on a trip to India to see family when I was about 13. It was a rural area and there were constant power cuts, and I would hog the candlelight just to read my book. My cousins and I used to sleep in a shared area. There were eight of us in an open space, and I\u2019d be in the bathroom reading my book with the light on, keeping everyone awake. I\u2019d tell myself, \u201cTime to go to bed now... Actually, let\u2019s just read another couple of pages.\u201d The next thing I knew, it would be the early hours of the morning.\n\nHe who must not be named: how Harry Potter helps make sense of Trump\u2019s world Read more\n\nIt was almost a guilty pleasure, because at school I was kind of the cool kid, a joker in class, and not many of my peers read the books. Nina and I bonded over Harry Potter, and got together in sixth form. It became competitive: \u201cI know more about Harry Potter than you\u201d or, \u201cI\u2019m a bigger fan than you.\u201d I\u2019ve got to be honest, I think she\u2019s probably winning.\n\nNina\u2019s almost like a real-life Hermione. I always thought of myself as Harry, but the more I think about it, I\u2019m more like Ron. He has the same courageous traits as Harry, but he comes from a very big, close-knit family \u2013 he\u2019s got lots of siblings, he\u2019s a bit dopey and goofy, just like me.

Photograph: Alan Powdrill for the Guardian\n\nI grew up in Zimbabwe. When I was 10, my gran brought me the Potter books when she came to visit. She could afford only two copies of each, so my younger cousins got photocopied versions.\n\nWhen I was 13, we moved to England. It was a very stressful time and Harry Potter was a source of comfort. For the first two years, I didn\u2019t understand what it was to be typically British, in terms of your emotions or how people socialise. It was really different from school in Zimbabwe, where there was a lot of corporal punishment; here, kids were so much more independent and opinionated.\n\nI made wands for myself, my wife and my two best friends\n\nI\u2019m a fairly creative person and a couple of years back I took up whittling. I made wands for myself, my wife and my two best friends. I wanted them to reflect their personalities and magical qualities. I made my own similar to the Elder Wand; my wife\u2019s was twirly and kind of like a unicorn horn; and my two friends got darker wands. At my wedding last summer, my young cousins were playing with my wand and it got snapped in half, just like at the end of the film.\n\nPotter has never really ended for me. My wife threw me a Harry Potter-themed 27th birthday party. I got a cloak and some Gryffindor pyjamas; she made pumpkin pasties, then we all dressed up and got pissed on butterbeer.

It\u2019s hard to tell whether the vogue for reboots is based on sepia-tinted nostalgia or simply a dearth of blue-sky thinking. Certainly, one might look at the simultaneous revival of one-time ratings-busters The Crystal Maze (30 June, 9pm, Channel 4) and Blind Date (24 June, 7pm, Channel 5) and wonder whether the great brains of our major television networks simply all lived in the same 1990s student house.\n\nThe most startling element of these particular reboots is their determination to replicate the originals with little concession to our altered times. In the case of Blind Date, the format is identical: a contestant puts questions to three potential dates hidden behind a screen. The questions studiously avoid topics that might aid their decision-making, such as: \u201cLeave or remain?\u201d and: \u201cWhen were you last tested for an STD?\u201d Instead, give or take the odd double-entendre, the enquiries are wilfully gauche and elicit similarly gauche answers.\n\nBlind Date's back \u2013 and a lorra lorra laughs is what we need in the wasteland of 2017 Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Blind Date 2.0, with Paul O\u2019Grady.\n\nPaul O\u2019Grady is our host, replacing Cilla Black and employing the same repertoire of eye-rolls, mild asides and forced laughter. Given the number of times he mentions his predecessor, it\u2019s evident that O\u2019Grady views the whole enterprise as a memorial to his old pal, though you can\u2019t help thinking that a plaque would have done the job just as well. Meanwhile, Melanie Sykes is the new \u201cour Graham\u201d, the voice originally employed to provide a recap of the contestants\u2019 USPs. Sykes gives it her all, which, let\u2019s face it, isn\u2019t saying much: she\u2019s almost literally phoning it in.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that this week also sees the return of Naked Attraction, a dating show in which contestants inspect each other\u2019s genitals before engaging in conversation. As a concept, it\u2019s profoundly unappealing. But it does perhaps indicate an appetite for something more edgy than people perched on stools spewing greetings-card banalities.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch a clip from the celebrity special of The Crystal Maze.\n\nThe Crystal Maze has aged better than Blind Date, not least because the concept \u2013 people in boilersuits run around themed polystyrene sets, engaging in physical and mental challenges \u2013 is more dynamic. Like Blind Date, it obsessively cleaves to the original template. Maze-master Richard O\u2019Brien has been exchanged for Richard Ayoade in velour, looking like a benign Child Catcher. The contestants in this game are \u201ccelebrities\u201d, though only in the loosest sense. There are no Idris Elbas or Adeles rowing across crocodile-infested waters. Instead we get Jodie Kidd, Joey Essex and assorted interchangeable TV presenters playing memory games, while Ayoade gently takes the piss.\n\nIt\u2019s not especially sophisticated but there is warmth, camaraderie and just enough tension to keep you willing the teams on. Crucially, there are no walkouts, bust-ups or closeups of people crying. There is no talk of emotional rollercoasters, learning or journeys; no judges willing them to fail. Where the new Blind Date suffers from not being 21st-century enough, The Crystal Maze\u2019s virtue lies in its distance from it. Ultimately, it\u2019s just low-rent celebs scampering around and being silly. If this is the new nostalgia, then hand me my rose-tinted specs.

Nothing quiets the din of a great gathering, albeit briefly, like the appearance of chocolate cake. What music does to soothe a savage breast, so too does a chocolate cake with its ability to make the eyes of a crowd mist over. It inspires the familiar questions: how good is it? Is this even better than the last one? Was the chocolate skimped on? Is the chocolate the best, or bulked out with Scotbloc? And the answers are always the same. Very! Yes! No! Absolutely not!\n\nMy Mum made a very fine chocolate cake, particularly to celebrate my sister\u2019s birthday \u2013 the same one every year. While her family made much joyful hullaballoo at the table, Mum added the finishing touches to the cake \u2013 a great affair, chocolate on chocolate on chocolate, with much cream. God, it was good. The very definition of scrumptious, the birthday treat deluxe. No death by chocolate here: this was life-enhancing stuff.\n\nChocolate has always been rare and expensive, and as partial as I am to a Cadbury\u2019s Picnic (which is the best off-the-peg chocolate bar), you need the best stuff when it comes to cooking. There are many merchants who supply Quo Vadis with good things, but a chocolate delivery enjoys a place all its own. There is really only one rule: bitter is best and a high percent cocoa fat \u2013 at least 70% \u2013 is needed for a good result.\n\nThere is something of the Scarlet Pimpernel about the recipe below: it is an elegant French recipe \u2013 an aristocratic gateau St Victoire that sought passage across the channel and became a chocolate cake. The Can-Can-like qualities of my sister\u2019s childhood birthday cakes are the stuff of Vaudeville-esque dreams, and now, a little older, they have matured into an elegant dish that sits, like my sister, most demurely at table.\n\nChocolate cake\n\nServes 6-8\n\n370g bitter plain chocolate\n\n3 tbsp dark rum\n\n100ml espresso\n\n4-5 tbsp warm milk\n\n9 eggs, separated\n\n200g caster sugar\n\n70g cocoa powder\n\n150ml double cream\n\n1 vanilla pod\n\nFor the sauce\n\n250ml milk\n\n1 tbsp ground coffee\n\n3 egg yolks\n\n50g caster sugar\n\nSpicy apricots in syrup with lemon thin dippers by Jeremy Lee | King of puddings Read more\n\n1 Line a springform cake tin with a cartouche of baking or silicone paper. This is most important as the cake is baked in a bain marie. Heat the oven to 130C/250F/gas mark low. Put a roasting tray in the oven and have a kettle with boiled water standing by.\n\n2 Put the chocolate in a large bowl. Sit the bowl over a pan of simmering water. Melt the chocolate gently. Once liquid and smooth, add in the rum and espresso, then the warm milk. If the chocolate remains stiff, add a little more milk until it surrenders and becomes smooth once more.\n\n3 Add the egg yolks to a bowl one at a time. Add the caster sugar and beat the mixture together until pale and voluminous. Beat the egg whites until peaked and stiff.\n\n4 Sift the cocoa powder. Add one-third to the chocolate along with a third of the egg mixture. Stir until all is incorporated and smooth.\n\n5 Decant the batter into the cake tin. Lightly smooth the surface with a palette knife or spatula. Sit the cake in the roasting tray in the oven. With great care, pour hot water from the kettle into the tray, so the tin sits in a moat of water \u2013 a classic bain marie. Bake for 45-50 minutes.\n\n6 If in any doubt about doneness, insert a skewer to see if it is cooked through. This cake is best when slightly undercooked, so fear not should a little of the mixture adhere to the skewer.\n\n7 With a cloth in each hand, lift the whole tray from the oven and sit upon a wire rack. Let the cake cool in the bain marie, then remove it. Exercising a little patience, take the paper from the sides and cut away. A bold heart can try and remove the base but I think it best to leave it and warn fellow companions to beware any paper. As you wish.\n\n8 For the sauce, pour the milk into a saucepan. Add the coffee. Warm to a simmer over a gentle heat. Set aside for 30 minutes, or until infused.\n\n9 Combine the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl. Pour the infused milk on top. Return all to the pan. Stir this over a gentle heat until thickened, as for a good old-fashioned custard.\n\n10 Once done, strain through a sieve into a bowl. Cool.

It hurts, you tell the midwife, although you can\u2019t feel anything, being so high on morphine already that someone could hit you with a sledgehammer and you would only laugh: what else you got? It was close to midnight on 13 August 2013, and I was on medical-grade opiates; nothing else can make you forget you are about to give birth. Eleven years without alcohol or drugs, and I fell, complete, into the waiting groove. I loved it. I was having a party in the high-risk maternity ward and they didn\u2019t even know it. I lay back on my pillow and gurned with joy: oh, Morpheus, god of dreams.\n\nWhen the morphine ran out, I had a baby. He was very small and handsome, and he was an imposition. I could say I was frightened, but that would be self-serving. It is possible, even likely, that I was afraid. I was definitely high.\n\nI stared at him and thought: I am more vulnerable than you, even if you are a baby. Then I told the midwife: my husband is trying to kill me. My evidence was that he had brought me a tin of biscuits. This, then, was the comedown, and I was at the bottom of the curve. I must have said that the baby was not important to me, because my husband became angry and I became angry, and I told him I hated him and had never loved him. I considered walking out into the traffic, or throwing myself under a train, and that was our baby\u2019s first night on Earth. We went home and I locked myself in my bedroom, without the baby, and looked at photographs of him on Facebook, and ate a ham.\n\nStrange things can bring you to a crisis, like realising that you cannot read Dickens out of jealousy. Or more obvious ones, like thinking: the baby should live with my sister, she will do this better than me. Or, when he was two months old: when is he going to university? In my history of alcoholism, I have been at my most healthy when I knew that I was ill. If you remind yourself that you are ill, you can do better. Now, in my son\u2019s room, wishing his childhood away because I did not know how to care for him, I knew I was ill. I was not drinking or using drugs, but I was as lonely and frightened as I had ever been. I was back where I had started.\n\n***\n\nAlcoholism is a strange condition. If you survive the drinking stage, and many don\u2019t, it has relatively little to do with alcohol, which is merely the drug with which the alcoholic treats herself. It is, rather, a way of thinking, and continues long after you have stopped drinking. It is a voice in the head: a malevolent voice that wants you to die. I certainly see it that way: it makes it easier to pick my way through the days if I know what, exactly, I am dealing with. Is this the voice speaking, or not? Which one made a decision, and which one doubted it? To discover the true root of any plan can require forensic vigour, and much time. It is perpetual inner warfare.\n\nThe party in the maternity ward aside, I have not taken drugs or alcohol for 15 years. You might think I would be better by now, but for the alcoholic there is nothing as prosaic as \u201cbetter\u201d. There is only a daily remission, based on how you deal with the voice in your head. (\u201cHello, monster. Where have you been?\u201d)\n\nOne morning in early 2002, at perhaps 5am, which is, as all addicts know, when the night breaks, leaving you with mashed lips and mad eyes, I stood in front of the mirror in my mother\u2019s house. I had been drinking alcoholically \u2013 that is, without stopping \u2013 for almost nine years, and I was very near the end. I pointed at myself \u2013 I remember myself as a very attractive drunk, red-lipped and irresistible, but this is the voice again, for I was nothing of the sort \u2013 and I said, very clearly, \u201cI hate you and I wish you would die.\u201d I knew then what the voice in my head wanted, and how powerful it was. It made a mistake by being honest and, because it made a mistake, I lived.\n\nI could no longer blame circumstances or others; I would have to do something about it myself. It is frightening, seeing yourself wish death on yourself in a mirror, and \u2013 because you are full of cocaine, as well as alcohol \u2013 being able to remember it. Alcohol shrouds itself in blackout, and you wake to a queasy blank; but cocaine is very bright, and pointed \u2013 it is almost telescopic. I was frightened enough to attempt one year without alcohol.\n\nIt\u2019s frightening, wishing death on yourself in a mirror, and \u2013 as you\u2019re full of cocaine, as well \u2013 remembering it\n\nI was prepared to be conscious (I loved the WH Auden line \u201cBut who can live for long/In an euphoric dream?\u201d) but I was under the delusion I was a literary genius, even though the only job I could get at the time was as a freelance reporter for a now defunct Daily Mail showbusiness column called Wicked Whispers. Wicked Whispers was so awful that, occasionally, the subs forgot to put it in the paper and no one would notice. If the celebrities I stalked stared at me, and asked, kindly, about my pitiful excuse for a career, I was stunned. Looking askance at Gillian Anderson when she, clearly and without malice, pities you, is, for me, a definitive act of insanity.\n\nI was too scared to drink alcohol, but I couldn\u2019t do anything else about a condition I barely understood. I went to self-help groups in gloomy church annexes, which seemed as despairing \u2013 though less vivid \u2013 as what I had left behind, and heard people talk about \u201cspiritual growth\u201d. I missed my near-death, for it had not been boring. I did not know what they were talking about. I could not hear them. I said I was an alcoholic, because I supposed I must be, but I didn\u2019t really know what it meant.\n\nI did know I needed a new soul, the old one having broken, and I chose to build it with ink. I thought that I should be a famous journalist, so I stood outside the Daily Mail building and offered up a prayer, like Salieri: Lord, make me a great short-form showbusiness columnist, and then, if you think it right, Lord, may I progress to features. I got a job on the features desk, a job I called \u201cIdiot Girl\u201d. I was required to report in fancy dress \u2013 Saxon peasant, old woman \u2013 and I loved it. It was evidence of my survival: she mugs, she pratfalls, she lives! The voice was impressed, and temporarily silenced. (I believe everyone is a secret Daily Mail reader, even the voice.)\n\nI built a career in journalism but I felt, always, that the person in print had nothing to do with me. She looked like me, but she was my ghost, and she was not reliable. I could never stop working, but I could never stay in any job; as soon as I arrived, I yearned to leave. I became marvellous at being fired and learned to soothe, and even thank, the person who was firing me, the better to start again at the beginning. It was a game I played with myself. I would procrastinate over my work to stoke the fear, but I was not lazy. I met a sensitive, clever man and married him, but I worked on my wedding day. I worked on my honeymoon. I worked in the labour ward, until I was offered the morphine. I was terrified of losing things and I would try to lose them so I could be, momentarily, at peace. My husband, at least, knew that, which is probably why I chose him. I am not a complete idiot.\n\nI mourned the lives I could have lived if I had not been cursed with alcoholism. I could have been an MEP or a chef!\n\nI was, for a while, a columnist, but that was no good, either. To write a good column, I had to work myself into such a state of rage that the week was empty of anything else. I had a schedule of rage, which I followed dutifully; if I wrote on Wednesday, I would be numb on Thursday and would then stoke the rage over the weekend. On Monday, the rage would ebb, to be replaced by terror, which would reach a pitch on Tuesday night, after which I would write what seemed to me not sentences, but tiny, insistent stabs. That is not a job; it is a condition.\n\nI was still at the mercy of the voice, but she had regressed to sludge. She manifested as a cloud of anxiety that travelled with me and occasionally mutated, helpfully, into dread, and then back to anxiety. I was a cartoon character with a personal cloud, Charlie Brown with a mood disorder.\n\nLate summer in 2013, I was sitting in a self-help group. This one was surrounded by a very fine, old graveyard, like a metaphor, with many famous intellectuals in fabulous tombs; we sat calmly with the dead, as if we belonged there. The baby was at home in the cradle. I always said the same thing at this self-help group, and they were very patient with me. If I had published a good article in the previous 24 hours, I was happy because I existed in a form with which I was comfortable, and which other people could recognise and approve of. If not, I moped, and complained that I was not happy. I avoided self-help groups where they talked about their gratitude. I did not believe them.\n\nI listened and thought about how much, then, I hated being an alcoholic. I mourned the lives I could have lived if I had not been cursed with this condition. I could have been an MEP! I could have been a chef! I wondered, in a broad way, what had happened, and what I could do. I became aware, quite suddenly in the quiet by the graveyard, of the constancy of the voice. I had waited, every day for 15 years, to wake up and find she had gone, and that was my error.\n\nI knew then that she has always been there. When I was five, she told me my parents didn\u2019t love me. I remember repeating, very insistently, to my parents that I knew they did not love me, because she had told me so. Evidence doesn\u2019t matter to the voice; she kicks it away. She cherishes a passing piece of thoughtlessness, nurtures a harm. She lives in the small places beneath my conscious mind.\n\nWhen I was 10, she said I was friendless at a noisy suburban school. When I was 12, and mooching about the dull streets of Kingston upon Thames, she said I was alone, and probably always would be. For the nine years of my active alcoholism, she told me to drink, first because it wouldn\u2019t harm me \u2013 and what else was there? \u2013 and then because I couldn\u2019t be saved.\n\nShe says only what she can get away with. She could never, for instance, convince me that my sister doesn\u2019t love me; instead, she tormented me, when I was drinking, with the possibility that my sister might die. She wants so much to be believed, this voice, and is almost as pitiful as the other me, which is the one that is writing this story: the one that wants to live. I am quite aware how mad this sounds, but it is the truest narrative of my alcoholism that I can offer. Perhaps in 15 years I will have another one.\n\nWe coexist uneasily, today, the voice and I; she tells me to procrastinate over my work, to start fights, to give up. If I am unwary, she can plunge me into the deepest despair, and I have learned to construct an obstacle course to thwart her. It is made only of ordinary human love. Nothing else works.\n\nMy son helps me. His is three now, and knows what is important. \u201cI must teach you to play, Mummy,\u201d he says, and invites me, without irony, to pretend to be a monster. Then, of course, the voice whispers, \u201cYou have made him a parental child\u201d: a creature who will care for me and not himself. I try to ignore her, because I cannot send her away. But I wonder now if it is she who is afraid, and not I."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 08:00:02 GMT", "title": "What I\u2019m really thinking: the downstairs neighbour", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/what-im-really-thinking-the-downstairs-neighbour-life-destroyed", "text": "You flooded me with noise, abuse, water, cigarette ends, rubbish and sewage, and you didn\u2019t care that my life was being destroyed\n\nIt\u2019s more than 10 years since you moved in upstairs and wrecked my life.

The emergency steps were taken as thousands of local authority tenants were warned that their homes were enveloped in potentially flammable materials.\n\nThe Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said on Friday that buildings in Plymouth, Manchester, Hounslow and Camden had failed fire safety tests carried out at the Building Research Establishment (BRE).\n\nThe government has refrained from naming five other councils where buildings have failed fire tests while landlords and residents are informed, but Portsmouth confirmed that it was among them.\n\nSix hundred local-authority owned buildings where aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding panels were identified on Thursday for testing after the north Kensington tragedy, in which 79 people are confirmed to have died.\n\nIn a letter to councils this week, the DCLG permanent secretary, Melanie Dawes, said: \u201cIt is important to stress that ACM cladding is not of itself dangerous, but it is important that the right type is used.\u201d\n\nThe NHS is reported to be among organisations checking its buildings are safe. The Health Service Journal reported a letter had been sent to NHS trusts urging them to check buildings for combustible cladding after the fire. The government is checking hundreds of further public buildings to see if they pose a threat.\n\nConcern about the cladding panels has spread beyond the state sector, as it emerged that the UK\u2019s largest hotel group, Premier Inn, was reviewing the safety of its buildings amid fears that material used on some properties did not meet safety regulations. Councils were also examining schools and hospitals, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said.\n\nBut private landlords or property developers will not be compelled to submit samples of their buildings for testing, Downing Street confirmed. \u201cThe testing facility is available to them and we expect many will use it,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cWe are not compelling them.

The aluminium panels were found to have a polyethylene filler between them, the council said. Harley Facades, which also worked on Grenfell Tower, was responsible for the cladding at Clements Court, as the Guardian reported last week.\n\nThe fire brigade will carry out home safety tests in every flat in the block over the weekend, and a fire patrol will start on Saturday.\n\nIt also emerged that Salford city council decided to preemptively remove ACM panels from nine social housing tower blocks. Residents in the recently refurbished buildings run by Pendleton Together were told that the material would be taken down, though the tests have not yet proven conclusive.\n\nThe Salford city mayor said it was the \u201cright and moral thing to do\u201d. \u201cThere will be no waiting around in Salford while there are any questions about the safety of our residents,\u201d Paul Dennett added.\n\nOther council tenants face an anxious wait for the results of tests. In Lambeth, south London, the local authority has sent samples from all 31 of its blocks that are fully or partially clad and more than six storeys for testing, although a spokesman said Lambeth believed the materials used were \u201cfundamentally different\u201d from those used on Grenfell Tower.\n\nIn Wandsworth, the council announced it would retro-fit sprinkler systems to 6,400 properties in more than 100 blocks.\n\nPremier Inn, which has more than 700 hotels, said three of its properties \u2013 in Maidenhead, Brentford and Tottenham \u2013 had been specifically investigated during a \u201cdetailed assessment\u201d of its estate.

New sentencing guidelines introduced last year were expected to lead to higher fines for larger companies convicted of the most serious regulatory breaches.\n\nMeanwhile, the government said technical experts were undertaking urgent tests of the Hotpoint FF175BP fridge-freezer named by police as the cause of the fire and a decision on whether to order a recall would be taken shortly.\n\nConsumers who own a FF175BP (white) or FF175BG (grey) should contact the manufacturer but the government said there was no reason for consumers to switch off their fridge-freezer. Hotpoint expressed its condolences to the victims and said it would assist in the investigation.\n\nPolice said the official death toll had risen to nine but the number presumed dead remained at 79.\n\nMcCormack said every complete body had been recovered from the building, describing it as a \u201cvery, very distressing scene\u201d.

This led to immediate accusations, including from the singer Lily Allen, that the government was \u201ctrying to micromanage people\u2019s grieving\u201d and that the media was playing down the number of deaths.\n\n\n\nThe figure rose to 30, then 58, and on Monday was stated as being 79, a number which it was thought would not change significantly.\n\n\n\nSome question this however. Sarah Colbourne, 44, who lives close to the 24-storey block, told the Press Association: \u201cWe know over 20 people who aren\u2019t answering their phones, who aren\u2019t responding to my emails. They\u2019re not missing, they\u2019re dead. Children haven\u2019t turned up to school, or to activity groups my husband runs. They\u2019re not missing, they\u2019re dead. They\u2019re telling us it\u2019s 79. We\u2019re not stupid \u2026 it\u2019s in the hundreds.\u201d\n\nWith previous disasters there has not always been such uncertainty. The sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise ferry, at Zeebrugge, in 1987, caused 193 to die; there it would have been possible to arrive at a reasonably accurate figure swiftly as it was known how many passengers and crew were on board, and how many were rescued. In the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in 1989, which had an eventual death toll of 96 people, the number of victims was quickly apparent.\n\n\n\nGrenfell Tower is challenging because it is not known exactly how many people were in the North Kensington block at the time of the fire. Reports have stated it could have been between 400 and 600. In the chaos that followed it also took time to determine how many people reported missing remained missing, presumed dead.\n\nThe search and recovery operation is continuing. The responsibility for releasing the number and details of any deaths lies with police. The Met follows the internationally recognised Interpol disaster victim identification (DVI) standards, set up in 1982 and widely adopted across the world since 1984.\n\nThe DVI method demands time-consuming verification. It is not enough for a family member to identify a loved one. And, given the numbers involved, it can mean delay in a deceased person being \u201cformally identified\u201d by the coroner.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Grenfell Tower, because there is a criminal investigation, a Home Office approved forensic pathologist must provide postmortem evidence regarding cause of death.\n\n\n\nAccording to the DVI standards the deceased should be identified by dental information, DNA, or fingerprints. In some circumstances, a unique medical or physical feature, such as a numbered medical implant, may provide reliable evidence of identity.\n\n\n\nThis information is supported by \u201csecondary identifiers\u201d such as marks, scars and tattoos, in addition to supporting information such as clothing, jewellery and circumstantial evidence.\n\n\n\nOnly when all this information is reconciled will a detailed report be provided for the coroner regarding evidence of identity.\n\n\n\nThe Met police commander Stuart Cundy has acknowledged that these processes take time, but he said they were vital. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to me that families have complete confidence in our identification processes so they know it is their loved ones being returned to them, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so exhaustive and it can be very time-consuming,\u201d he said. \u201cOur absolute commitment to those families is that we do this work as quickly as we possibly can.\u201d"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:30:55 GMT", "title": "Grenfell tenants 'not exempt from bedroom tax or benefit cap'", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/23/grenfell-tenants-not-exempt-from-bedroom-tax-or-benefit-cap", "text": "Ministers say residents hit by welfare reforms should get discretionary payments to protect them from benefit shortfalls\n\nFormer residents of Grenfell Tower will not be exempt from the bedroom tax and the benefit cap, the government has confirmed \u2013 although ministers have ordered that any tenants affected are prioritised for special payments to offset any losses.\n\n\n\nGuidance from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says councils should ensure Grenfell tenants hit by welfare reforms should be given so-called discretionary housing payments (DHPs) to protect them from potential housing benefit shortfalls of hundreds of pounds a month.\n\nThe government has promised that all Grenfell residents will be rehoused permanently as close as possible to their former home. This week it secured 68 social rented apartments in a new block in Kensington to provide permanent accommodation for those made homeless by the fire.\n\nThe guidance is the latest example of ministers moving to soften normal benefit rules for Grenfell residents. Earlier this week it said jobless tenants would not be sanctioned for failing to look for a job, and that a planned roll-out of universal credit in North Kensington next month would be put on hold.\n\nA DWP spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have already relaxed benefit rules for anyone affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and our staff are handling people\u2019s claims with sensitivity, understanding and flexibility.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs part of this, our recent guidance to local authorities is that they should treat these residents as a priority for extra payments to help with their rent if they are rehoused in a larger property.\u201d\n\nWe have already relaxed benefit rules for anyone affected by the Grenfell Tower fire DWP spokeswoman\n\nBut experts said that providing DHP support was not always a permanent solution for tenants affected by welfare reform, especially if Grenfell tenants were allocated permanent homes that were too big and unaffordable under housing benefit rules.\n\nUnder the bedroom tax, residents in permanent social housing who are deemed to have more bedrooms than they require are docked housing benefit. In London, bedroom-taxed households typically have shortfalls of around \u00a323 a week.\n\n\n\nThe benefit cap limits the total amount of benefits paid to out-of-work households to \u00a3442 a week in London. In Kensington and Chelsea, latest figures show that in February 421 residents were capped. The majority suffered a benefit shortfall of \u00a3100 a week, though in some cases it was as much as \u00a3400 a week.\n\nDiscretionary housing payments, as the name implies, are normally given out at the discretion of the council and there is no guarantee that tenants \u2013 usually those at risk of homelessness as a result of rent arrears caused by welfare reform \u2013 will receive a DHP payment. The DWP guidance suggests councils should relax the usual rules for Grenfell tenants.\n\nEach local authority sets its own criteria to assess DHP claims, with claimants normally having to produce extensive details of bank accounts, savings and loans to justify why they should qualify for financial help to stay in their home. Kensington and Chelsea\u2019s standard five-page form asks claimants to justify why they \u201cneed to live at this address in this particular area\u201d and \u201cAre there any reasons preventing you from moving to other accommodation or another area?\u201d.\n\nAlthough the guidance states that there is no limit to the length of time a DHP award may be made, permanent awards are rare, and are often restricted to a few months.\n\nThis week a judge criticised DHPs in a ruling that declared it was unlawful for single parents with children under two to be subject to the benefit cap. Mr Justice Collins said that DHPs were a temporary solution that gave \u201cno peace of mind\u201d to capped tenants and provided an \u201cunsatisfactory safeguard\u201d against homelessness.\n\nHe added: \u201cFor those such as the claimants who are living on the edge of, if not within, poverty the [DHP] system is simply not working with any degree of fairness.\u201d"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 11:29:48 GMT", "title": "Frankie Boyle: 'Grenfell Tower residents were treated as less than human' \u2013 video", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2017/jun/23/frankie-boyle-grenfell-tower-residents-were-treated-as-less-than-human", "text": "Frankie Boyle tells Owen Jones he believes there\u2019s \u2018a connection between a Conservative government that wants to get rid of human rights legislation\u2019 and the residents of Grenfell Tower \u2018being treated as less than human\u2019.

There was one scrum that\u2019s caught us as well, and several areas where we need to be better at the set-piece.\n\n\u201cTheir tight five were very good, but we need to be tough on ourselves and honest in our performance. A lot of those things are fixable. We know what to expect for next week.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand and Rieko Ioane run away with first Test against Lions Read more\n\nGatland was impressed by the flair his team showed, and took a mild swipe at New Zealand\u2019s pragmatic approach.\n\n\u201cI thought we created some great chances, played some lovely rugby and scored some nice tries,\u201d Gatland said.\n\n\u201cThe All Blacks haven\u2019t exactly played champagne rugby and thrown the ball all over the place. There were a couple of golden moments that we could have taken and we just switched off when they caught us on a quick tap penalty for a try.\u201d\n\nHansen was eager to highlight his side\u2019s dominance up front, with the All Blacks foiling the Lions\u2019 plans to win the physical battle at Eden Park.\n\n\u201cI always find it amusing when people tell us they are going to beat us up in the tight five,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cWe can play down and dirty rugby too if we have to. And I mean down and dirty in the most respectful way.\n\n\u201cThis Test was always going to be won in the tight five.

You don\u2019t become the No1 side in the world without having a quality tight five.\u201d\n\nThe Lions were left to rue poor finishing after the world champions won a thrilling first Test thanks to two second-half tries from Rieko Ioane.\n\nCodie Taylor scored the game\u2019s first try to put the All Blacks ahead, before Ireland flanker Sean O\u2019Brien finished off a scintillating long-range move just before the break \u2013 a score Hansen called \u201cone of the best Test tries I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d.\n\nIn the second half, Gatland\u2019s side lacked the killer touch, as promising breaks came to nothing. At the other end, lapses in concentration were punished by Ioane\u2019s two second-half touchdowns. Rhys Webb went over in the final moments to narrow the margin of defeat.\n\n\u201cWe had an excellent first half and created plenty of chances,\u201d the Lions captain, Peter O\u2019Mahony, told Sky Sports. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with some of the opportunities we created but our discipline probably wasn\u2019t where it should have been at. We\u2019ve got a huge Test coming up next week and we\u2019ve got to recover now and regroup.\n\nRugby union: Schmidt relieved as Ireland beat Japan, Scotland lose to Fiji Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been put under pressure by a seriously good side at times but we\u2019ve got to be more clinical. We\u2019re making some good breaks and we\u2019ve just got to finish them off. We left at least two tries out there so I don\u2019t think 15 points is a good reflection.\u201d\n\nThe Lions centre Jonathan Davies agreed with his team-mate, saying: \u201cPoor discipline and errors probably cost us and to be fair to the All Blacks they were very clinical as always. But we can take a lot out of our game. We created a lot, it\u2019s just finishing off these opportunities. We can\u2019t leave tries out there.\n\nThe All Blacks captain, Kieran Read, added: \u201cIt was a hell of a Test match. We certainly got tested in that first half especially and just after half-time when our defence probably won us the game. \u201cIt was two skilful teams working really hard for each other.

Thus it was with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Miguel Indurain and Lance Armstrong \u2013 now disgraced, once perennially dominant \u2013 and so it is with Chris Froome, who starts the Tour as the overwhelming favourite, even though he has not yet shown the incisive form of his better years.\n\nThere is always speculation that the sheer weight of opposing numbers will one day overcome the counterweight of incumbency but it tends to be wishful thinking. Each of those contenders has his own priorities and the immense importance of the Tour induces a risk-benefit analysis: the favourites weigh up what they have to lose with what they might have to gain and all too frequently it is the former that consumes them.\n\nChris Froome: I have never been offered triamcinolone at Team Sky | William Fotheringham Read more\n\nPlay Video 1:45 Chris Froome: winning a fourth Tour de France would be 'incredible' \u2013 video\n\nFroome\u2019s verdict is that \u201cthere is a whole handful of guys on the start line with a realistic chance of winning\u201d. None punches with the weight of the Team Sky man but there are always reasons to hope that one July will produce a spectacular along the lines of the recent Giro d\u2019Italia, won by Tom Dumoulin in a thrilling finale. This might be that year: a three-times winner who might not be quite what he was, a finely balanced route that offers something for everyone, and that group of contenders, who may prove a \u201chandful\u201d but not in the sense that the defending champion meant.\n\nRichie Porte\n\nThe man to beat in Froome\u2019s eyes. The 32-year-old Australian has a fine season behind him already, with six wins under his belt including the Tour Down Under and the Tour de Romandie. He has made the transition from Froome\u2019s top domestique at Sky to leader at BMC and this year will prove once and for all whether he can go a step further in the Tour. Porte can time trial, he can climb and his team looks solid, albeit lacking the number of pure mountain specialists that Froome can call on. Porte\u2019s achilles heel is that he tends to be the victim of events, as in the 2015 Giro, the 2016 Tour or, most recently, the final day in the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9. That tendency leads to a simple question: can he emulate his old leader Froome and learn to dictate events on the road at the highest level?\n\nNairo Quintana\n\nA regular on the Tour podium, with second in 2013 and 2015 and third in 2016, plus a Giro d\u2019Italia win in 2014 and the Vuelta last year. The Colombian has enjoyed a strong year, winning Tirreno-Adriatico and taking second to Dumoulin in the Giro. That record means he will be a factor but Quintana is an enigma. In a massively mountainous final week of the Giro he was curiously muted, while at the 2015 Tour he had the form to oust Froome in the final week but did not seize his chance. His Movistar team are strong and skilled and the shortage of time trialling means this Tour will suit him more than any other. The two toughest days in the Alps should suit him most, too, so he needs to strike there to gain time before the Marseille time trial. The only question is how much he left on the road in Italy in May.\n\nAlberto Contador\n\nThe pistolero is evergreen or long in the tooth depending on how you see it. Contador has the best all-round record of any Tourman today \u2013 the Spaniard is one of the six riders to have claimed all three Grand Tours and has won each one at least twice \u2013 but his bid to win the Tour last year stalled badly; he last visited the podium of a major Tour when he won the Giro in 2015. At 34, if he does have one last Tour win in his legs, it will come from his peerless skill at seeking out and exploiting openings. That instinct is born of 10 years winning at this level but will it compensate for the advancing years? His Trek-Segafredo team is not as strong as Sky or Movistar but that is less of an issue. If he rides strongly in the first major test, the three\u2011col stage to Chamb\u00e9ry, all bets are off.\n\nWheels have not come off cycling\u2019s boom despite elite holes in the road Read more\n\nRomain Bardert\n\nIn the last two Tours stage wins in the Alps have defined the style of the 26-year-old Frenchman from Brioude: opportunistic and aggressive uphill, skilful when the road goes down. Equally key, he seems able to cope with the pressure that comes with being a home contender in the Tour. He finished runner-up to Chris Froome last year when Porte and Quintana faltered, and took the race to the Sky leader on the rain-hit stage to the foot of Mont Blanc. The question now is whether he can go one better and what that would take. The scant time trialling in this year\u2019s race suits Bardet and so does the relative lack of set-piece climbing, with only two conventional mountain-top finishes. His Ag2R team is not at a level with Sky, meaning he needs to arrive in the final week either level-pegging with Froome or in a position to test the favourite. It is a big ask but it is not impossible.\n\nThe best of the rest\n\nThibaut Pinot, Fabio Aru, Esteban Chaves all merit a place on the list of contenders if not headline billing. Pinot is going into the unknown in racing the Tour after a promising but ultimately frustrating fourth in the Giro. The Frenchman will fly or die but at least the pressure is off, as he has struggled to carry the weight of home hopeful in the past. The Italian Aru and Colombian Chaves will find there is a world of difference between tackling the Tour to learn and taking it on to win, but both have strong teams in Astana and Orica-Scott; Chaves will form an intriguing double act with the promising Briton Simon Yates while Aru has the ageing Jakob Fuglsang of Denmark to act as his foil."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 12:39:52 GMT", "title": "Royal Ascot 2017: Diamond Jubilee Stakes and more \u2013 live!", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2017/jun/24/royal-ascot-2017-diamond-jubilee-stakes-and-more-live", "text": "12:07\n\nLast year\u2019s Royal Ascot closed with the kind of drama that would seem contrived in a novel, the Queen\u2019s colours being carried to victory in a big race by a fancied horse who had to survive a close finish and a stewards\u2019 inquiry. Dartmouth, for it was he, is back today for another crack at the Hardwicke Stakes and this doughty yeoman of a horse will surely serve his owner well once more.\n\nWhether he can actually poke his nose in front at the line is another matter. This much faster ground is not in his favour and his trainer, Sir Michael Stoute, has been missing the target all week, albeit narrowly in a number of cases. Royalists and traditionalists may not get their happy ending this time.\n\nBut most major race-meetings leave smiles on the faces of Aidan O\u2019Brien and Ryan Moore and the pair are odds-on to make it back to the winner\u2019s enclosure at some point today, very possibly with the classy youngster September in the opening race at 2.30pm.\n\nMoore has become almost Piggott-esque in his ability to elbow his way onto a good horse\u2019s back, when not riding for O\u2019Brien. He could land the two big sprints that highlight today\u2019s card, on Limato in the 4.20pm and Raucous in the 5pm, neither of which were his rides last year. Indeed, the owner of Limato restated his faith in his regular jockey, Harry Bentley, just last month, but Bentley will be watching today\u2019s action from Newmarket.\n\nThe racing surface has been fast all week and might be fastest of all today, since there was no artificial irrigation last night and the forecast showers did not appear. Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, says he might add \u201cfirm in places\u201d to the going description before racing starts. Backing that up, the GoingStick reading for the stands\u2019 side is 9.8 and not much lower for the far side at 9.6, indicating drier conditions than usual for this race-meeting. The centre of the track is moister at 9.0 and punters will look with suspicion on any jockeys who stay there throughout a race today.\n\n"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 08:00:02 GMT", "title": "Cherish the Age of Usain Bolt \u2013 it will be gone in 90 seconds | Barney Ronay", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/24/usain-bolt-retirement-farewell-season", "text": "What term do you want to search?"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 12:37:14 GMT", "title": "New Zealand 30-15 British & Irish Lions: first Test player ratings", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/24/new-zealand-british-and-irish-lions-first-test-player-ratings", "text": "Brodie Retallick was key to the All Blacks\u2019 success in collisions and at the breakdown, while Alun Wyn Jones did not do enough to warrant his selection for the Lions\n\nNew Zealand\n\nBen Smith, full-back 6/10 Coughed up a few of Murray\u2019s high kicks before making way in first half for a HIA and failing to return.

Reliable under high ball, always looking to make things happen and made crucial tackle to deny Daly in the corner.\n\nRyan Crotty, centre 7/10 A shame he had to depart after such an impressive start. Not too many frills but extremely solid and does the basics so well. A couple of key tackles before injury struck.\n\nSonny Bill Willams, centre 7/10 Fairly quiet \u2013by his standards anyway \u2013 until Te\u2019o went off. He will relish renewing that duel. His were hard yards but his relentless running did help New Zealand win the gain-line.\n\nRieko Ioane, wing 8/10 Billed as the next big thing for a while but nothing fazes this kid. Smiling from ear to ear just before kick-off and clinically took his tries. Burned off Daly \u2013 no slouch \u2013 for his second.\n\nBeauden Barrett, fly-half 8/10 Faultless. Not too many fireworks but seamlessly moved to full-back. Goal-kicking supposedly a weakness so inevitably he did not miss. Outrageous one-handed pick-up.\n\nAaron Smith, scrum-half 9/10 Back to his best. New Zealand went through him more than expected but he is so sharp of pass and of mind. Kicked excellently, too, and made crucial tap-tackle on Murray.\n\nJoe Moody, prop 8/10 Carried the fight to the Lions and clearly felt he had a point to prove after losing out in his battle with Furlong in the Crusaders match. He certainly made it at scrum-time.\n\nCodie Taylor, hooker 8/10 Suffers from comparisons to Dane Coles but picked Dagg\u2019s pass off his bootlaces for try in a way of which his fellow hooker would have been proud.

Just a brute.\n\nSam Whitelock, lock 7/10 After Davies ghosted past him he barely put a foot wrong. The Lions thought they would had the edge in the tight five but Whitelock and Retallick are a fearsome duo.\n\nJerome Kaino, flanker 6/10 Like his captain, there were concerns that Kaino would be undercooked after such little rugby recently. Not hugely noticeable and made way after less than 50 minutes.\n\nSam Cane, flanker 9/10 The All Blacks\u2019 victory was based on their breakdown dominance and Cane was their best operator there. He carried, won turnovers, offloaded \u2013 pretty much perfect.\n\nKieran Read, No8, capt 9/10 No right to perform like that after such a long lay-off.

A counterattacking threat all match but mistake led to second Ioane try.\n\nAnthony Watson, wing 8/10 Showed his stepping ability early in the second half but lacked composure when trying to offload. Snuffed out a try with a superb catch and will certainly keep his place.\n\nJonathan Davies, centre 8/10 Waltzed past Whitelock in the first couple of minutes and made another scything break soon after half-time. Missed a couple of tackles but not alone in that regard.\n\nBen T\u2019eo, centre 8/10 Decision to take him off backfired as he was edging his titanic tussle with Williams. Made one huge, if illegal hit on ex-NRL rival, ran hard and answered questions over defence.\n\nElliot Daly, wing 7/10 Just short after Davies\u2019s early break and missed chance to put Williams clear. Key role in O\u2019Brien\u2019s try, though \u2013 leaving Lienert-Brown with twisted blood \u2013 and chased very well.\n\nOwen Farrell, fly-half 6/10 Began well but failed to stamp authority with such little front-foot ball. Kicking from hand fine but missed conversion significant. Got wires crossed with Sexton a bit, too.\n\nConor Murray, scrum-half 6/10 Tackled heart out \u2013 though missed a few \u2013 and box-kicking was on the money. Could he have found Daly after Davies\u2019s break? It was a difficult pass but Smith would have nailed it.\n\nMako Vunipola, prop 6/10 Failed to make desired impact when carrying but not for lack for trying. Huge work\u2011rate but was part of a front row that hoped to make the scrum more of a weapon.\n\nJamie George, hooker 5/10 Made 17 tackles and nothing wrong with his lineout throwing. Gatland would have liked more in the loose and at the breakdown, though, so Rory Best comes into contention.\n\nTadhg Furlong, prop 5/10 Another willing carrier but found yards hard to come by and did not have the impact at scrum-time he would have liked. May be a hard week ahead under Graham Rowntree\u2019s watch.\n\nAlun Wyn Jones, lock 4/10 A rare off-day. Edged into side ahead of Itoje and did not do enough to warrant selection. Normally so consistent, not his typical warrior-like performance.\n\nGeorge Kruis, lock 5/10 Another who did not give up but for all his lineout acumen, he could not match physicality of Retallick opposite him. Missed three tackles \u2013 but made 16 \u2013 and was stripped in contact.\n\nPeter O\u2019Mahony, flanker, capt 6/10 A spirited performance and the Lions\u2019 go-to man at the lineout. Troubled New Zealand\u2019s as well but not enough impact at the breakdown before making way.\n\nSean O\u2019Brien, flanker 6/10 Finished off a try for the ages but he was outgunned at the breakdown by Cane. Carried hard, as always, but he has had more influence against the All Blacks in the past.\n\nTaulupe Faletau, No8 7/10 The Lions\u2019 top tackler with 20 but would have preferred to be doing his work where he can be more effective in attack.

If he wants to play again, he will be 29. By that time, the sport at which he has a rare talent will have changed considerably and he might think it not worth the candle to get back in shape and give it another go. He will have no ranking, no wildcards \u2013 just a wild past and some wonderful memories.\n\nThere are some \u2013 no, many \u2013 who will write Evans off as disrespectful of his talent. Andrew Castle, the former British No1 who had his own run-in with the tennis establishment (although for no bigger crime than wearing an anti-poll tax slogan on his T-shirt), put it most bluntly: \u201cHe has chucked his career away. A massive mistake. Foolish.\u201d\n\nJohn Lloyd, once his Davis Cup captain, said: \u201cThe bottom line is how many chances do you get?\u201d\n\nTwice in his youth, the Lawn Tennis Association withdrew Evans\u2019s funding because of his night-time escapades. He lost a junior doubles match at Wimbledon in 2008 after leaving a local nightclub at 3am with his playing partner, Daniel Smethurst. In 2010, he was the victim of an LTA cost-cutting cull, his rebellious nature no doubt counting him against him.\n\nThen two years ago, on the weekend of St Patrick\u2019s Day, his career reached what friends and critics alike regarded as its most significant turning point. He failed to turn up for a Futures match on the Wirral, later saying that he was out with friends and had lost track of time. It was up there with the dog ate my homework as an excuse. Nobody was much impressed.\n\nBut Evans did something about it this time. He trained harder, took his trade more seriously \u2013 and started winning more matches.\n\nHe rose quickly through the rankings from 688 into the top 100 and beyond, as the soft hands and the quick eye for an opening clicked with pleasing synchronicity. He began to beat players that once were on another level: Marin Cilic in the Australian Open this year on his way to the fourth round of a slam for the first time, building on probably the best performance of his career, when he held match point against Stan Wawrinka in the US Open the previous September. Everything now seemed possible for Evo.\n\nAs he told the Times on the eve of leading the Great Britain Davis Cup team against Canada in Ottawa in February: \u201cI obviously made a lot of wrong choices when I was younger. I ended up getting there in the end. I let a few people down on the way, hopefully now I am repaying them.\u201d In March, he reached a career high of 41. He had a good amount of money in the bank \u2013 $1.3m in career earnings, $405,918 of that this year alone \u2013 a sponsor, a girlfriend and the warm support of thousands of British tennis fans.\n\nI recall meeting him in a New York bar the night he lost to Wawrinka. He was with his father, David, and a few friends from Birmingham. He had given it his best shot, although he rued butchering a simple smash that would have carried him to a memorable triumph over the eventual champion, and he was relaxing in the glow of another fine run. He had maybe one or two bottles of lager over the course of the evening. He seemed very much to have reined in his irresponsibility.\n\nBut, after years of coping with struggle, he now had the challenge of meeting higher expectations. When he was regarded as no more than a talented but wayward prospect capable of occasional brilliant things, the pressure was different: then he had a career to build. Now that he had delivered on that talent, he had to keep his discipline to stay at another level. He had to keep winning bigger matches or a regular basis. There could be no more running home to the comfort of the West Warwickshire Sports Club in Solihull and the acclaim of his friends. Now he was a proper professional tennis player.\n\nThen, for whatever reason, he made the sort of mistake not uncommon among athletes who are feted and admired. It was a drastic lapse in judgment.\n\nIt will be a desperate shame if Evo\u2019s last match turns out to be the quarter\u2011final at Surbiton two weeks ago when he retired with a calf injury while leading 6-3, 4-2 against Dustin Brown. It was a Challenger event, the sort of tournament he played so often in his wilderness years, honing his skills far from the glare of judgment, in front of hardly anyone but his mates and family. It was where he often felt most comfortable, just hitting a tennis ball.\n\nHe might not have gone too deep at this year\u2019s Wimbledon but he would have given it a shake. It will gall Evans to dwell on it but, if the exciting young German Alexander Zverev delivers on his potential at the All England Club, he will still have on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 a defeat by Evans at last year\u2019s US Open. On that day Evo was that good.\n\nWhen Evans took that cocaine in Barcelona in April, before his first match in the tournament (he would go on to reach the third round on his least favourite surface, losing in two tight sets to Dominic Thiem, at the time the world No9), he might not have given a thought for the consequences. It was, he insisted on Friday, unrelated to tennis \u2013 and that might be his only defence when he goes before an International Tennis Federation tribunal at a date to be determined.\n\nIf he were of a mind, he might look his inquisitors in the eye and quote another apt Wildean witticism: \u201cI can resist everything except temptation.\u201d"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 08:58:13 GMT", "title": "Mauricio Pellegrino, the complete coach who hates losing and frets when he wins | Sid Lowe", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jun/24/mauricio-pellegrino-complete-coach-southampton-manager", "text": "There were around 40 people on the coaching course Mauricio Pellegrino took when he was a player at Valencia in 1999 and he wanted to know what it was that moved them to be there, so he did something he has done ever since football took him from his home in the Argentinian pampas: he asked and he listened. There were all sorts of reasons but surprisingly few matched his. For some, it was just something to do. For others, it was about money, just a job. Not for Pellegrino. He asked a friend there whether he would take it if a tiny third division club came for him. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cCoaching\u2019s not your vocation, then,\u201d Pellegrino replied.\n\nIt is Pellegrino\u2019s. \u201cHad it not been for football I would never have left home,\u201d he once said. He was a little introverted, at least to start with, and one former team-mate says football is his life while he told a player who worked under him that through football he found a way to express himself. Especially through coaching, his calling. He has emerged and evolved over the years but even as a player he was a manager. Louis van Gaal once said: \u201cHe\u2019ll make a great coach.\u201d Although Pellegrino was not pleased, joking that meant the Dutchman did not think he was much of a centre-back, Van Gaal is not a man given to handing out compliments and he knew he was right.\n\nSouthampton appoint former Liverpool coach Mauricio Pellegrino as manager Read more\n\nPellegrino did not always think he was much of a player, either: he was too tall, too skinny, too clumsy, he had problems with his back. But there was something about him that team-mates and coaches appreciated that took him to Barcelona, Valencia and Liverpool, and a coaching career that now brings him to Southampton via Spain and Argentina. \u201cHe makes you think,\u201d his former centre-back partner Roberto Ayala says. He makes himself think, too, particularly about others.\n\nThe goalkeeper Santi Ca\u00f1izares, a team-mate at Valencia, says: \u201cHe shared his experience with everyone: he listened and advised, analysed, put himself into people\u2019s skin: he was practically a psychologist. He was not our best centre-back but he was the centre-back the coach most valued. He always had a positive attitude, he had no jealousy at all, no anger, it was always, always about the team. He understood tactically, he was obsessed with the team, he took responsibility: too much. He was ashamed by defeat. I\u2019ve known very few players like that. He has three things: incredible humility, complete professionalism and he never celebrated victory.\u201d\n\nPellegrino once admitted: \u201cFootball was my school of life but I had a big deficit as a player: I didn\u2019t enjoy it.\u201d Now he believes he can help players do so and he has changed a little but that idea played a part in shaping him. \u201cIn Argentina football is cultural,\u201d he explained to El Pa\u00eds. \u201cLosing is a drama; winning is only good because it means not losing. The social rejection you feel when you lose makes us very competitive.\u201d Winning, by contrast, blunts your edge and avoiding that is something that preoccupies him. \u201cObsesses him,\u201d according to one friend.\n\nCa\u00f1izares shared that attitude and laments its loss in the game but laughs when he recalls Pellegrino asking before the 2001 Champions League final: \u201cWhat if we win? How will we get our humility back?\u201d \u201cBloody hell, Flaco,\u201d he replied. \u201cLet\u2019s just win first, yeah?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mauricio Pellegrino, playing for Valencia, has his penalty saved by Oliver Kahn in the shootout of the 2001 Champions League final to give Bayern Munich the title. Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters\n\nThey called Pellegrino Flaco, the Skinny One, everywhere except at Barcelona, whom he had joined in 1998; Johan Cruyff was the only Flaco there. Pellegrino never worked under Cruyff but he did work with Van Gaal, who swiftly saw something in him.\n\nAt Valencia, Claudio Ranieri saw it too, as did H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper. Under him they did not win that Champions League final, and Pellegrino missed the decisive penalty in the shootout, but Ca\u00f1izares insists: \u201cTo win, you have to lose first.\u201d Two consecutive European Cup final defeats were followed by two league titles in three years, Valencia overcoming the gal\u00e1cticos, and the manager who led that historic side certainly saw something in him. Rafael Ben\u00edtez took Pellegrino to Liverpool with him in 2005 \u2013 as much for what he could do for the team as what he could do in it.\n\nHe stayed only a season but returned as Ben\u00edtez\u2019s assistant in 2008, although one former player says he was still a peripheral figure, occupying a backseat. He watched and listened, as he always had: as a player, Pellegrino would question every decision \u2013 not because he was accusing his coaches but because he was analysing them. Never standing still, never satisfied that he had found a definitive answer.\n\nAntonio Conte urges Chelsea to sign Leonardo Bonucci or Virgil van Dijk Read more\n\nHe has said he learned organisation from Marcelo Bielsa, space from Van Gaal. With Ben\u00edtez, he saw the obsession with tactics, and England from the inside, how it is played and lived, what it means culturally. The feel for the game and for his players, though, is his own \u2013 and there\u2019s a moral element to it. \u201cPeople have less religious belief and less belief in politicians: the only thing we have left to identify with is the shirt,\u201d he has said. \u201cThat\u2019s for life: grandad, dad, grandson united by a colour. I\u2019m not against business, but I don\u2019t want that cultural part to be lost.\u201d\n\nPlayers confirm Pellegrino, the son of farmers, repeatedly tells them that sport challenges the values of society, where individualism prevails. Society, he says, demands that you win, that you have the best car, the most money; football demands that you help your team-mate, even if that means not scoring, not playing, not being in the spotlight. If the team are better, you are better. Yet achieving that means engaging with individuals, understanding. \u201cWhen I grew up coaches never asked: \u2018How do you feel?\u2019 But if I don\u2019t ask a player, how am I going to know his dreams?\u201d he has asked.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mauricio Pellegrino, right, with Rafael Ben\u00edtez, left, and Xavi Valero in 2009 during a spell on Liverpool\u2019s coaching staff. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt Alav\u00e9s last season, that dream was a Copa del Rey final \u2013 only the second cup final, after the 2001 Uefa Cup which they lost to Liverpool, in the 96-year history of the club from Vitoria in the Basque Country. \u201cHe transmits to the players what the club and the city mean: he has built a side the fans identify with,\u201d says the captain, Manu Garc\u00eda, born in Vitoria and a lifelong member at Mendizorroza. \u201cHe\u2019s a very complete coach; not many have the tactical awareness of the game and also so much talent for group management. He and his staff have a lot of \u2018left hand\u2019; they have the whole team plugged in, they avoid conflict, everyone gets an opportunity.\u201d\n\nPellegrino has two assistant coaches, Carlos Campagnucci and Xavi Tamarit, author of a book on the theory of periodisation fathered by V\u00edtor Frade and followed by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, among others. His fitness coach, David Rodr\u00edguez, and the goalkeeper coach, Javier L\u00f3pez Vallejo, complete the team who have had a huge impact in Vitoria.\n\nAs Garc\u00eda talks enthusiastically through Pellegrino\u2019s tactical variations, his model as it shifts from 4-4-2 into 4-3-3, the multiple functions of the full-backs, the two central midfielders becoming one, the striker dropping in, the search for numerical superiority, you get a feel for the depth of understanding, the way it is mechanised, pieces interlocking, every element interdependent. \u201cI\u2019m 31, and of course I\u2019ve learned a lot from all my coaches, but in just one year he has taught me to understand the game so much better than I did before \u2013 and that\u2019s not such an easy thing to do,\u201d Garc\u00eda says.\n\n\u201cHe sees the game very well. He is a strategist, he analyses opponents closely and he believes in juego posicional [a positional game]. He has a lot of faith in that approach, in defence but also in attack: respect the positions, a well-ordered team, everything under control. He likes his team to express the way he is: intelligent, understanding, ordered. He works hard during the week and the things he plans for usually happen at the weekend.\u201d\n\nNot that there is any guarantee, Pellegrino knows: the opposition play, too, and defeat awaits. He spent his playing career desperate to avoid it but he has come to accept it and learn from it, too; it made him who he is. He also knows that it has an impact on the way he is seen, even if he does not change. He knows there is no single answer and that virtues can soon be seen as vices.\n\n\u201cFootball is like two people dancing: if the other person treads on your toes, you can\u2019t lift your heels,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s 22, not 11. There is what you want to do and what you can do. Experience shows that good results and bad results are part of the same packet. If you\u2019re calm and you win people say: \u2018The team is doing well because he\u2019s calm.\u2019 If you lose, they say: \u2018He\u2019s so calm he can\u2019t get the team going.\u2019 You can see a prince or a frog in every player, every coach, and everyone.\u201d"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 07:15:01 GMT", "title": "Steve Harmison: \u2018I didn\u2019t want the public to know about my depression\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/24/steve-harmison-cricket-depression-public-interview", "text": "The former fast bowler was the world\u2019s best when he led England\u2019s attack at the 2005 Ashes but tells Donald McRae he spent the peak of his cricket career battling depression and feared fans would not understand\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through a fucking hell of a lot,\u201d Steve Harmison says in the deserted bar of Ashington Football Club on a quiet afternoon. \u201cI\u2019ve had the upmost highs and the lowest lows. I\u2019ve gone from being the No1 bowler in the world, to bowling that ball in Brisbane [when, in 2006, Harmison delivered the most embarrassing opening delivery of an Ashes series]. I\u2019ve gone from feeling on top of the world to being in a clinic in the Priory. How much higher can you get and how much lower can you go? I don\u2019t think you can.\u201d\n\nThis past week has felt like the dog days of summer across most of the country but, in Northumberland, the heat has been muted.

Depression, however, always stalked him. \u201cThe important thing is I\u2019ve come out the other side of it. If a kid playing cricket now has the same problems I would love to help them overcome adversity. I had to do it myself. I had the best family, I was earning good money, I was the best bowler in the world. At that point [in 2004], I was at my darkest. The fact I kept going is my biggest achievement because you never overcome depression. But if you don\u2019t cave in, that\u2019s a real strength.\u201d\n\nHarmison and I have already reminisced about our last poignant interview in December 2004. He led the world rankings after a stunning year for England, which included him taking seven for 12 as he destroyed West Indies in Kingston with pace, bounce and venom. England were on their way to South Africa, for a tough series win which would strengthen their resolve before the Ashes, when Harmison and I met at Heathrow.\n\nHe cried a little as he stared at the reflection of the international departures sign in the dirty window of an airport caf\u00e9. \u201cToday is the day I wish I wasn\u2019t a professional cricketer,\u201d Harmison told me then. \u201cToday is the day I wish I worked in an office in a nine-to-five job. This is the worst day I\u2019ve known as a cricketer. There have been an awful lot of tears in the family today. How do you tell your kids you won\u2019t be home for 10 weeks? It\u2019s just being away that kills me.\u201d\n\nI thought: just bump into somebody else's car and I'll miss my flight and get three more days at home\n\nHe was suffering from depression which, officially, was described as \u201chomesickness\u201d. I wrote: \u201cIf homesickness is a kind of illness, then Harmison suffers from a distressing form of the ailment.\u201d\n\nTwo years before Marcus Trescothick left an Ashes tour because of mental health issues and long before Michael Yardy and Jonathan Trott suffered similar difficulties, Harmison faced torment. He might be the last of this England quartet to publish a book but his autobiography Speed Demons is affecting and moving. It is also alarming as Harmison reveals that, on the morning of our 2004 interview, he had considered driving his car into another as a way of avoiding his flight to South Africa.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d just bump into somebody\u2019s back end and say my neck is sore and I\u2019ll get an extra three days at home,\u201d he says now of causing a possible accident. \u201cBut that would have made it worse because I would have had to fly on my own. I never would have got there.\u201d\n\nIt seems incredible the severity of Harmison\u2019s depression was not addressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think mental health was highlighted then. It was only later, when Marcus got really poorly that people stood back and thought about it. It ended Marcus\u2019s international career but then the next player came and the next. All of a sudden, people began to understand our problems.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Harmison takes the wicket of Australia\u2019s Ricky Ponting during the first Ashes test in 2005. In his new autobiography, Harmison says cricket gave him a \u2018release\u2019 while battling depression. Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Action Images\n\n\u201cI was happy to have my depression labelled as homesickness because I would\u2019ve been a hell of a lot worse if I wasn\u2019t playing cricket. A lot of people in cricket knew about my depression but I didn\u2019t want the general public to know. People can tolerate you having a poor game. They can say: \u2018OK, he\u2019s homesick.\u2019 But they would be less tolerant of a poor game when mental health issues are mentioned. My fear was they wouldn\u2019t allow me back. I desperately needed to play cricket and, at first, I just thought it was when I went away. I remember being in Disneyland Paris crying my eyes out but I was also doing it at home. I really had to seek help.\u201d\n\nDid it help when he was diagnosed as suffering from clinical depression? \u201cYeah, because that explained things. I went to the Priory and the doctor said: \u2018I don\u2019t know anything about cricket.\u2019 The relief was unreal because I thought: \u2018Great, he\u2019s going to talk to me about the symptoms rather than the cricketer.\u2019 He would see me as a human being. I feel the same now. I\u2019d go back once a week if I had to because it helps so much to talk about it.\u201d\n\nCan he handle bouts of depression more easily now? \u201cYeah, because I\u2019ve dealt with them for so long. I know how to hide in a hole, go quietly into hibernation for a few days. It tends to last a couple of weeks but it\u2019s only three or four days where it\u2019s really bad. You learn to cope and, at its worst, you know the next day will feel better. But it\u2019s harder because I don\u2019t have that release of playing cricket anymore.\u201d\n\nHarmison now manages Ashington in the Northern League Division One. He receives only expenses but the focus of looking after a team has steadied him in retirement. \u201cUntil I got into the football I was in a void. Alcohol then played a massive part. You\u2019d say: \u2018I\u2019ve not got anything to do so I\u2019ll go out and have a couple of beers.\u2019 I never had a problem with alcohol but I used it to fill the void when I finished playing. It made me feel a little better as I was drinking but I was a thousand times worse the next day.\n\n\u201cMy problem was being on my own. It\u2019s the same now. Doing the media stuff you travel back and forward to places and you\u2019re alone in your head. You spend a lot of time ringing people up just to talk to somebody. Your mind is amazing but it can be quite dangerous. The biggest part is you don\u2019t sleep and sleeping pills are addictive. I\u2019ve got off them now but I\u2019ll only sleep three or four hours a night. So I have good days and bad days.\n\n\u201cAt the minute I\u2019m quite content and trying to move forward but I still don\u2019t really have a structure to life. Football helps but it\u2019s not a job. I would like a job working in cricket because I\u2019ve got the expertise. I\u2019d love to think something would come up at Durham but right now they don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with their finances.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Harmison: \u2018I\u2019d still love to work with England one day but I\u2019m not sure they would give me a job after what I\u2019ve said\u2019 Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian\n\nNext month it will be 12 years since Harmison and England were at the forefront of public consciousness, as the 2005 Ashes transfixed the country on terrestrial television. \u201cPeople were being locked out of the grounds and it was an amazing summer,\u201d Harmison says. \u201cThere was no football on TV and we got 8.75 million people watching cricket. It is sad that, today, most people outside cricket don\u2019t know Joe Root or Ben Stokes. I sometimes work on Sky and the way they present the game to an armchair fan is phenomenal but we\u2019ve not got enough armchair fans now.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see what happens with the next TV rights. I hope the ECB gets it right, not just from a money point of view because we need as many people as we can to see this England team. These kids are unreal. Root, Stokes, Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow, Mark Wood, Jos Buttler. This generation could be missed which would be so sad. I want everybody to watch Buttler at his peak \u2013 hitting balls the way he does. I want the game to spread across the whole country again.\n\nJonathan Trott said 'I'm not a nutcase'. You don't use those words to talk about mental health\n\n\u201cI also worry about the players. I look at this winter\u2019s schedule and Root, plays all three formats. He\u2019s got a baby who, by the time he leaves, will be [nine] months old. Soon after that, the baby is going to start walking and those are great things to see with your first child. Joe\u2019s going away in October and might not come back until May. Yes, the family is going [to Australia] but it\u2019s not the same. I know how tough it is because I was away for the birth of Abbie [the second of his four children]. She was three months old when I saw her the first time.\u201d\n\nHarmison admits there is \u201ca disconnect\u201d between him and his children \u2013 a direct consequence of being away so much when they were young. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of distance because I wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m probably going to be closer to my grandchildren than my own children. It pains me to say that. On the other hand they\u2019ve had an amazing mum in Hayley. But even now it hurts that I missed the kids so much. One year I spent 300-odd nights in hotel rooms.\u201d\n\nIt is surprising that, despite his sensitivity, Harmison should question the mental health issues suffered by Jonathan Trott. He has suggested that after the former England batsman left an Ashes tour in 2013 he spoke like someone who was mentally weak rather than mentally ill. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the interview he did for Sky where he said the word \u2018nutcase\u2019. You don\u2019t use those words to talk about mental health. He said: \u2018I\u2019m not a nutcase.\u2019 To me it looked as if he\u2019d had a hard time on the field and wanted to get out of the kitchen.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Cricket World Cup: team-by-team guide to the tournament | Vithushan Ehantharajah Read more\n\nSurely Harmison\u2019s own problems have taught him not to judge other people without knowing exactly how they were feeling during a personal crisis? \u201cI\u2019ve just given my opinion and I really hope I\u2019m wrong. If I am I\u2019ll be the first to shake Jonathan\u2019s hand and say: \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He is a great cricketer and I think England arguably missed him more than anybody else.\u201d\n\nHarmison\u2019s application for a role as an England selector in 2014 only received a standard ECB rejection email, without any personal response to a player with 63 Test caps and 226 wickets. \u201cI\u2019d still love to work with England one day but I\u2019m not sure the ECB would give me a job after what I\u2019ve said. They chose the right selector in Angus Fraser, he\u2019s got great experience, but I wanted to help and even now, I would still love to work with young players.\u201d\n\nWhile he waits to find out how his life may unfold over the next few years, Harmison can feel pride in withstanding the black dog of depression. \u201cI tried my best and I didn\u2019t let it beat me. That\u2019s the underlying achievement. It\u2019s not the length of the career, the games played or wickets taken. I had a real struggle in the middle of my career and I came out the other side of it. At the end of it, I felt a sense of achievement. I felt proud of myself.\u201d\n\nSteve Harmison\u2019s Speed Demons is available from the Guardian bookshop"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:18:32 GMT", "title": "Arsenal hopeful of landing Lyon\u2019s Alexandre Lacazette with record \u00a344m bid", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/23/arsenal-alexandre-lacazette-lyon-record-bid", "text": "\u2022 France striker would become London club\u2019s most expensive signing \u2022 Offer likely to be accepted by Lyon and player is expected to accept move\n\nArsenal are hopeful of securing the highly rated France striker Alexandre Lacazette after lodging a club record bid worth \u00a344m, a fee likely to prove acceptable to Lyon and spark a flurry of knock-on movement in the transfer market.\n\nA number of teams had registered an interest in Lacazette, who has 11 caps and is contracted to Lyon until 2019 after graduating through their exceptional academy system. The player had initially expressed a desire to join Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, having deemed the time right to further his career by departing Ligue 1, but the Spanish club\u2019s transfer ban, which stands until January 2018, has complicated their pursuit and allowed Arsenal to steal a march on the 26-year-old\u2019s other suitors.\n\nAlexandre Lacazette: lethal, in demand and hungry to prove worth for France | Sachin Nakrani Read more\n\nLacazette is believed to be more open-minded now on the move after talks between officials from the London club and the Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, this week, and agreement is close over the fee. The deal would trump the \u00a342.5m potentially due to Real Madrid for Mesut \u00d6zil, who signed in 2013. Further discussions are planned for the start of next week with Lacazette, who is on holiday, expected to pursue the chance to play in the Premier League.\n\nThe striker, who has scored a century of league goals for Lyon in 203 top-flight appearances, is eager to make his mark at club level before the 2018 World Cup finals in Russia and is facing stiff competition within Didier Deschamps\u2019 France squad from emerging talents such as Kylian Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nLacazette had hoped to feature in the Champions League next season, a competition for which Arsenal have failed to qualify after finishing fifth.

This sporting riddle was indigenous to Orebro County \u2013 a relatively well-populated region nestled into Scandinavia\u2019s forested heartland. There\u2019s a proud football tradition out here. But on this day, after this match, in this competition, I felt like I\u2019d stumbled into another sporting universe. The riddle went something like this: a referee blows his whistle to signal half-time with the away team, my Karlslunds, two-nil up. The opening 45 minutes\u2019 only goalscorers are my team-mates Nabil Osman and Carl Grundel. Yet when the second half kicks off, eighth-tier Hidingsta are back in the game and the scoreboard reads 2-2. How?\n\nFootball rule-makers to consider reducing games to 60 minutes Read more\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked my room-mate Alex, an American goalkeeper, when he returned from the match. I had been rested for the midweek cup tie and was bemused as I followed the game on Twitter. Karlslunds ultimately triumphed 5-2, Twitter reported, but the events surrounding half-time remained a mystery.\n\nHere is what didn\u2019t happen: no underhand tactics occurred during the interval. No bribery or intimidation. No honest officiating mistakes, either. The volunteers working the Hidingsta scoreboard were not guilty of sneaking a pair of goals in the home-team column as the crowd queued for their half-time meatballs. Everything was above board and within the rules. Yet somehow the scoreline going into the second half was legitimately 2-2.\n\nWelcome to the Eksjohuscup. It\u2019s here, within this competition\u2019s quirky rulebook, we find the answer to our riddle and perhaps, to some degree, within the Swedish sporting psyche too. You see, the Eksjohuscup is a knockout cup unlike any other and has a genuine claim to be the most bizarrely formatted tournament in world football. In each fixture, to counteract a bigger club\u2019s natural advantage, the lower-ranking team is awarded a series of bonus penalty kicks.\n\nSweden: land of the midnight sun and fairness for all. But does equal opportunity really translate into competitive sport? In a knockout football tournament pitting top-flight professionals against non-league amateurs can fairness truly be achieved?\n\nIt is said dodgy pitches and snarling crowds are \u201cgreat levellers\u201d when Premier League sides draw non-league minnows in the English FA Cup. But out here in Orebro County, equality is more quantifiable. At least according to this radical tournament format.\n\nThe rules are these: in each tie the lower-ranking team receives the same number of bonus penalties as the number of league divisions they are below their opponents. Four tiers separated Karlslunds and Hidingsta, so our opponents received four spot\u2011kicks. The lower-ranking team, who also enjoy home advantage in every Eksjohuscup fixture, can choose to take these penalties before the match kicks off, immediately before the second half gets under way or, in perhaps the most bizarre twist of all, a combination of both. Hidingsta shot all four spot-kicks \u2013 which can be taken by one or multiple players \u2013 after the half-time interval, converting two. Ergo, the head-scratching 2-2 scoreline I saw flash up on Twitter and the answer to our riddle.\n\nIt\u2019s a bonkers competition but kind of brilliant too. Teams from Orebro County\u2019s top nine tiers enter and matches are typically played in high spirits. Sponsored by the local housebuilding company Eksjohus, the cup exists partly to offer smaller clubs the opportunity to claim valuable prize money, which is awarded after each round. Thanks to the unconventional format, all teams have a realistic chance of success. And bizarre situations abound.\n\nDepending on the draw, up to nine bonus spot-kicks can be awarded, although a maximum of three converted penalties count. So the greatest advantage a lower-ranking team can enjoy over superior opponents is a three-goal head start. Still, any ambitious amateur side would fancy themselves defending such a lead. Quite often, they succeed. The revolutionary 1-10 formation is particularly popular with Eksjohuscup minnows. Or parkera bussen as they say in Sweden.\n\nThe Joy of Six: Short-lived football rule changes Read more\n\nUnlike in traditionally formatted knockout cups, the best teams on paper do not necessarily go into any tie as favourites, and lower-league sides regularly lift the trophy. Last year, sixth-tier Scandinavian toppled fifth-tier Bosna in the final, assisted by one freebie spot-kick. In the quarters, Yxhults, also of the sixth tier, knocked out the tournament\u2019s single Allsvenskan (Swedish top flight) club, Orebro \u2013 a team once managed by Roy Hodgson, who remains revered in the region. Having won the previous round 11-2, Orebro scored three goals without reply against Yxhults during their 90 minutes of quarter-final action. However, before kick-off, their clinical opponents had bagged a maximum head start. So the match ended 3-3 and progressed to a shootout. Yxhults banged in five more penalties to eliminate the Allsvenskan club and advance to the semi-finals, a few thousand Swedish kroner bolstering their club kitty. All eight goals conceded by the Orebro keeper that night came from 12 yards.\n\nAs my team\u2019s penalty taker, I dream of scoring the quintessential Eksjohuscup hat-trick one day \u2013 three goals after zero minutes. But in both my seasons here I\u2019ve watched Karlslunds cup runs end against lower-league opponents buoyed by bonus spot-kicks. In our experience, the competition\u2019s rules effectively offset the gulf in talent. Losing always stings, but on each occasion it hasn\u2019t felt unfair.\n\nIt\u2019s a funny old tournament but in an era when inequality defines top-level football perhaps this kind of lateral thinking has some merit. Last season, four of England\u2019s top five teams contested the FA Cup semi-finals. While Orebro County is a world away from Wembley, maybe, just maybe, as the old domestic trophy loses some of its former lustre, exporting this brilliantly bizarre competition format from the Swedish forest could be one way to bring the magic back."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:38:32 GMT", "title": "Dan Evans reveals positive drug test for cocaine \u2013 \u2018I made a mistake\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/23/dan-evans-positive-drugs-test-cocaine", "text": "Dan Evans, the British No3 and world No50 tennis player, revealed in a brief and emotional statement on Friday that he had failed an out-of-competition test for cocaine.

After he had served two and a half months, an International Tennis Federation tribunal panel lifted the ban, accepting the Frenchman\u2019s story that he had inadvertently taken cocaine by kissing a woman in a nightclub.\n\nEvans offered no excuse, and it is not known if he is preparing a defence for an appeal if, as seems certain, the ITF bans him. In a carefully worded statement , the ITF said Evans was tested \u201cin association with his participation at the Barcelona Open on 24 April\u201d.

He has often performed heroically for Great Britain in the Davis Cup and, intermittently over the past year, has played impressively. At the US Open last year, he had match point against Stan Wawrinka, who went on to beat Novak Djokovic in the final.\n\nThis season Evans found form on clay as well as his favoure hard court and rose to a career high of 41 in the world in March.

Sunday will be his 196th Formula One start, having taken his first title for McLaren in 2008 and the two for Mercedes in 2014 and 2015.

People ask me what\u2019s motivating you and I still want more. I feel like I have more potential and it\u2019s a constant journey to discover what that potential is.

Given that link, officials at the Merseyside club may feel emboldened enough to approach Southampton about completing a move for Van Dijk.\n\nThat is unlikely to happen any time soon, however, given the Premier League is awaiting observations from Southampton and Liverpool before determining whether it should open a tapping-up investigation into the latter\u2019s conduct.

Against the odds South Africa won a topsy-turvy contest, laced with a touch of controversy, by three runs. It was a gutsy performance by South Africa and a profligate one by England. For a capacity crowd there was drama and ultimately disappointment when Liam Dawson hit the penultimate ball of the match for four, but was unable to do so with the next.\n\nIt had at one stage seemed such plain sailing for England. With six-and-a-half overs to go they had nine wickets intact and needed just 50 runs more. But after the controversial dismissal of Jason Roy \u2013 he was given out for obstructing the field \u2013 the run chase wilted as South Africa fought back grittily.\n\nThe target was modest by Taunton standards and Roy had been in the mood. He cracked his second Twenty20 half-century, his sparkle now restored after that barren run, using most parts of his bat. Two consecutive inside edges off Morne Morkel were a source of considerable exasperation to the tourists, after which he tended to use the middle of the bat in his 67 from 45 balls. It all looked so simple.\n\nThen came Roy\u2019s dismissal, which was something of a collector\u2019s item. He tried to regain his ground after setting off for a single and the subsequent throw at the stumps hit his heel. It was a tough decision for the third umpire Tim Robinson, who was fervently booed by most of the 12,420 people in the ground. A deliberate change of direction had been spotted.\n\nEngland v South Africa: second T20 international \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nThereafter England fluffed their lines as South Africa sensed an unlikely victory. Jos Buttler, back on home soil, could not swing the game; nor could Lancashire\u2019s Liam Livingstone on his debut. Eoin Morgan came in at six but he could not rescue the situation either. Dawson swung dutifully but the target of 12 runs required from the final over from Andile Phehlukwayo proved to be just beyond him.\n\nMorgan did not use the Roy dismissal as an excuse for the defeat after the game. \u201cIt was not massively controversial. I thought it was a 50-50 call,\u201d the captain said.\n\n\u201cYou could see why he gave it out. It did not cost us the game, we still had enough firepower to win it. But we didn\u2019t deserve to. We could not capitalise on the start by Jason [Roy] and Jonny [Bairstow]\u201d. Morgan was obviously disappointed at squandering a winning position, and was also eager to point out how dark it was at the conclusion of the game.\n\nApart from the result, it all went according to plan for the hosts. Every seat was taken (they could have sold out several times over); the pitch was lively and the welcome warm. Somerset have been planning for this match for over a year and their efforts were rewarded. Even the trains down the road were running on time, while the Quantocks remained visible in the background.\n\nSouth Africa made a better fist of posting a decent target than in the first match at Southampton. Even so, 174-8 guarantees you nothing at Taunton, where the pitch is often true and the boundaries are always short.\n\nAt least Jon-Jon Smuts gave a hint of why he is in the side after his golden duck in the first match. One of his straight drives might have done serious damage to the umpire Michael Gough, had the ball not clipped the stumps at the bowler\u2019s end before ricocheting off to the boundary. The opener ultimately delivered a meaty 45, including three sixes.\n\nEngland and India ready for battle in Women's World Cup opener Read more\n\nThe real threat, as ever, came from AB de Villiers. He purred along more convincingly than at any stage of South Africa\u2019s British trip, scoring at more than two runs per ball. Against David Willey he stepped to the off-side and played an astonishing shot, sending the ball over his left shoulder, out of the ground and into the River Tone. On the next ball, he attempted to drive and the bat swivelled in his hands, the ball travelling vertically rather than horizontally. Morgan was grateful to take the catch at extra cover. His 46 from 20 balls was a fine cameo, but no more.\n\nIn the field, England were patchy. Tom Curran, given his first cap along with Liam Livingstone, was impressive. He bowled straight, hit the deck hard and fully deserved his three wickets. The Curran brothers are gifted cricketers, and they appear to have the knack of making the most of their ability.\n\nIt was not such a satisfactory outing for Chris Jordan, whose reputation as England\u2019s best fielder is under threat. One ball flew between his legs, a straightforward catch \u2013 by his standards \u2013 was spilt and he was responsible for four of the five wides bowled by England. He may have to make way in Cardiff on Sunday.\n\nEngland had shuffled their side but Sam Billings, given a chance at the top of the order,was unable to excel, splicing a short ball from Chris Morris in the second over. For the second match in succession, Roy and Jonny Bairstow prospered together.\n\nWhile Roy was prepared to try any shot, Bairstow leant more heavily on powerful orthodoxy; some of his straight driving was awesome. They added 110 together in fine style before Bairstow was caught at mid-on for 47.

Should he get through those sessions and the match itself, the 31-year-old will be clear to take on South Africa in the Test series.\n\nScans after he pulled up against Leicestershire on Wednesday have shown some bruising to the fat pad on his heel and a possible minor tear but he is already said to be running without pain.\n\nGary Ballance appears primed for a Test recall this summer after being named as captain of the England Lions side that will take on the South Africa first XI next week, as well as being cleared for the first half of Yorkshire\u2019s day-night fixture with Surrey. The left-hander has averaged 101.8 from seven Division One matches this summer and his Yorkshire team-mate, Joe Root, is known to have pushed his case for a middle order spot when he captains England for the first time against South Africa at Lord\u2019s on 6 July.\n\nBefore that comes the floodlit round of County Championship matches, starting on Monday. All 18 counties will play to prepare England players for the first day-night Test with West Indies in August, and Ballance will take part for the first two days at Headingley before captaining the Lions against the touring Proteas at Worcester from Thursday.\n\nBallance is colour-blind and has struggled to see the ball used in day-night cricket but work with an optician and the new black seam stitching on the Dukes ball is thought to have remedied the problem.\n\nEngland play three day-night Tests in the next 12 months, with West Indies at Edgbaston followed by one apiece on the tours to Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTim Bresnan will take over the Yorkshire captaincy when Ballance departs, although Root may yet step in with Bresnan\u2019s wife expecting their third child.\n\nThe Durham opener Keaton Jennings has also been named in the Lions squad for next week. Another interesting inclusion is the Hampshire leg-spinner Mason Crane, who made his England Twenty20 debut on Wednesday and is thought of as a possible Ashes tourist.\n\nThere is no place for the Lancashire opener Haseeb Hameed, who shone for England against India last winter but has since struggled for runs, making 0 and 2 for the Lions against South Africa A this week."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 18:22:50 GMT", "title": "Marin Cilic books Aegon Championships semi-final and targets run at Wimbledon", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/23/marin-cilic-aegon-championships-queens-club", "text": "The late Bud Collins, who cast his knowing gaze over the game for several decades, eulogised Marin Cilic seven years ago in terms rock writers once reserved for Bruce Springsteen.

Clutching the boots which had just helped England reach the semi-finals of the European Under-21 Championship on Thursday night for the first time in four attempts, the forward who learned his trade in the junior section of Cadbury Athletic \u2013 the non-league club in Birmingham\u2019s south-western suburbs, affiliated to the world-famous confectioners, that produced Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge \u2013 twiddled his headphones in his hands and thought for a second.\n\n\u201cIt is all about opportunities,\u201d he finally replied when asked about the key to his development. \u201cPlaying at first-team level is how you progress the best. You learn about the real game. Managers have to trust you and give you a chance. If they do, we will have more English talent coming on show.\u201d\n\nEngland sail past Poland to reach European U-21 Championship semis Read more\n\nGray should know what he is talking about. In the aftermath of Leicester\u2019s remarkable title triumph last summer, the player who does not celebrate his 21st birthday until next week was spotted proudly wearing his Premier League winners\u2019 medal while strolling round the city centre. Yet after making 11 substitute appearances for Claudio Ranieri\u2019s class of 2016 after signing from Birmingham for \u00a33.75m that January, he was named on the bench a remarkable 38 times in all competitions as Leicester reached the Champions League quarter-finals and briefly flirted with relegation.\n\nSo one can imagine what went through Gray\u2019s mind when the England Under-21 manager, Aidy Boothroyd, opted not to select him for their opening two matches against Sweden and Slovakia here in Poland.\n\n\u201cI was on the bench a lot last season and it was frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was one of those things. I kind of kept myself motivated with this tournament. I didn\u2019t start the first two games but I have had to apply myself. I have good people around me and I always believed I will get my opportunity. I scored and got an assist, so I am buzzing.\u201d\n\nHis long-distance strike after six minutes of the showdown with the hosts settled English nerves as they went on to record a comfortable 3-0 victory that ensured they topped Group A. But while that owed something to fortune, given the large deflection off a defender\u2019s head that sent the ball spinning past the helpless goalkeeper, there was nothing lucky about his role in Jacob Murphy\u2019s clinching goal in the second half.\n\nReleased down the left by Lewis Baker\u2019s excellent pass, Gray bided his time before cutting into the box and delivering the perfect ball for the Norwich man to seal the victory.\n\n\u201cIt was three v two and I had to time the pass,\u201d he reflected. \u201cThe second goal was important. The pass was the right decision and it killed the game off right there.\u201d\n\nThose who have watched his development might have expected the player who burst into the Birmingham first team as a 17-year-old in October 2013 to have pulled the trigger himself. But with so much riding on that moment as England sought to build on the positivity created by the under-20 side\u2019s World Cup win in South Korea this month, Gray showed he is learning fast despite his lack of gametime under Ranieri and the Italian\u2019s successor, Craig Shakespeare.\n\nNathan Redmond winner completes England comeback against Slovakia Read more\n\n\u201cI thought I was ready last season but sometimes you have to be patient,\u201d he said. \u201cAny opportunity you get you\u2019ve got to try and express yourself.\n\n\u201cI am hungry and want to make my mark. I don\u2019t feel like I have been able to do that as much as I want. I used this tournament last season to motivate me to show what I am capable of. As soon as I get a chance I want to have my best game.\u201d\n\nGray added: \u201cThe under-20s\u2019 achievement was massive and has given us motivation to follow in their footsteps. They are younger and to win something so big was nice to see. We saw their celebrations and we want the same celebrations here.\u201d\n\nGiven the way they have grown into this tournament after a ponderous start in the 0-0 draw against Sweden, there is now every chance that could happen. Gray, who has been linked with moves to Tottenham and Liverpool this summer after reports that he was unhappy with his peripheral role at the King Power Stadium, insisted his only concern was guiding England to a first victory in this competition for more than 30 years.\n\n\u201cNext season is not here for me yet but I just want to keep up my performances out here,\u201d he said. \u201cCraig Shakespeare has always been there for me at Leicester. He always spoke to me one on one. With him getting the job now I am happy with that and hopefully I will get more of an opportunity.

He has always loved the cricket and the microphone in equal measure. And he is one of life\u2019s great troupers. Yet now we learn that, at 77, he has announced his retirement from TMS in September. It is a bit of a shock.\n\nHis last game on air is scheduled to be England\u2019s third Test against West Indies at Lord\u2019s. When he bids farewell expect something more flowery than John Arlott\u2019s final sentence on TMS in 1980, which was: \u201cAfter a word from Trevor Bailey it will be Christopher Martin-Jenkins\u201d. For Henry, pigeons will presumably assemble around St John\u2019s Wood like the Red Arrows.\n\nEngland\u2019s Stuart Broad doubtful for South Africa Test with heel injury Read more\n\nHenry has adorned the TMS box for 45 years with a few interruptions (like the good freelance, he had a go with Sky TV for a while before returning to the fold). I have had the good fortune to sit alongside him now and again for more than 25 of those years, marvelling at his energy, his preposterous ability to spot butterflies and buses, and his intimate knowledge of the game of cricket. While Henry may struggle to identify the exact name of the bloke fielding at third man, he could give you every last detail of the England team that won the Ashes in 1956 or in 1981 when he was commentating at the end of the famous Botham Test at Headingley.\n\nHenry\u2019s zest for life is remarkable. In the 1960s this was reflected by his decision to drive to India in a vintage Rolls-Royce to cover an England tour with John Woodcock of the Times as one of his travelling companions. On one distant subcontinental tour he almost played for England as sickness hit the dressing room. He was easily the best qualified among the press corps to do so since he was a prodigious young batsman and wicketkeeper at Eton and Cambridge. My impression is he played a few shots. In this decade he is still tearing around the country \u2013 and will continue to do so \u2013 treading the boards, talking of cricket and anything else that takes his fancy. He loves an audience.\n\nThat zest sometimes necessitated the odd early departure from a cricket ground. Henry wrote about cricket for the Guardian regularly in the 1980s. Once at a routine county match at Chelmsford he left a little early for a pressing engagement having dutifully filed his copy, which focused upon Essex\u2019s innings of 287 and with the last sentence reading: \u201cand at the close Surrey were _ for _\u201d. Unfortunately Surrey were bowled out for 14 in the last hour. Fortunately a young Matthew Engel was on the desk and did a little more than simply add the numbers 14 and 10 to Henry\u2019s copy.\n\nHe has written for most newspapers, adjusting to fresh demands and equipment along the way. The sight of him counting the words of a piece he had written on a newly acquired laptop springs to mind. It just seemed to spoil the fun to inform him of a button called word count. But perhaps his most memorable work has been for the BBC.\n\nI have witnessed many epic broadcasts, sometimes when there has been no cricket happening at all. In Brisbane in 1998 there was a biblical thunderstorm when Henry was on air. Suddenly his antennae were triggered. This was something exceptional and off he went on an extraordinarily vivid monologue. Within days this was compulsory listening on Pick of the Week.\n\nHis stock phrases can be easily interpreted. \u201cMy dear old thing\u201d came about because he could not remember names infallibly. Watch out for \u201cyou\u2019re absolutely right\u201d, which means \u201cI haven\u2019t been listening to a word you\u2019ve been saying for the last few minutes but it\u2019s my turn now\u201d.\n\nThis lovable old rogue, who knows the game inside out, will be genuinely missed on the airwaves. Women and children were often special fans. There is still a twinkle in the eye and mischief in the voice. And if his absence is hard to bear, do not worry; the old trouper will be appearing at some theatre near you very shortly."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:17:17 GMT", "title": "F1 could learn a few things from the magnificent Le Mans 24 Hours | Richard Williams", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/23/f1-could-learn-le-mans-24-hours", "text": "What term do you want to search?"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 10:19:12 GMT", "title": "Women\u2019s sport is coming in waves and ready to shine during biggest summer | Andy Bull", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jun/23/women-sport-biggest-summer-chance-to-shine", "text": "Women\u2019s sport sometimes seems to run along a parallel timeline, one that lags behind the rest of life. It was 2012 before women were able to compete in every event on the Olympic programme, 2014 before they could play professional cricket in England, 2016 before they could play professional rugby, and in 2017 they were finally allowed to join Muirfield golf club, the latter providing the best excuse yet to recycle Groucho Marx\u2019s old line: \u201cI don\u2019t want to belong to any club that will accept me as a member.\u201d Rory McIlroy was asked about male-only golf clubs back in 2013. \u201cIt\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t even be talking about,\u201d he said. Four years later we still were, and McIlroy was asked again. \u201cIn this day and age,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere you\u2019ve got women that are heads of state and not able to join a golf course \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s obscene.\u201d\n\nObscene, but in keeping. A quick flick through the history of women\u2019s sport shows that these milestone dates invariably run late. Until 1960, women were banned from running distances over 200m in the Olympics, because the IOC was convinced that their bodies could not cope with the strain. Until 1971, women were banned from playing football on many grounds because the FA thought the sport \u201cquite unsuitable for females\u201d. Until 1976, women were not allowed to even step on to the outfield at Lord\u2019s, never mind play cricket on it. It was 1991 before Fifa organised the first women\u2019s World Cup, and 1998 before the IRB finally sanctioned a rugby event. All in all, female athletes have had to put up with an awful lot of bullshit.\n\nThis summer will give a good idea of exactly where women\u2019s sport is at. The Cricket World Cup starts in England on 24 June, the Uefa European Championship begins in the Netherlands on 16 July, and the Rugby World Cup is being played in Ireland from 9 August. England are among the favourites in all three. The football team is ranked fifth in the world, their cricket team is second behind Australia, and their rugby team are the defending world champions. If these were men\u2019s events there would be wall-to-wall coverage of all three tournaments. But they\u2019re not, and there won\u2019t be. Instead they will have to fight for space with the Lions tour, the Test series against South Africa, Wimbledon, the World Athletics Championships, and, of course, all those football transfer stories.\n\nAccording to Women In Sport\u2019s most recent survey, women\u2019s sport makes up only 7% of all sports coverage in the UK. Broken down, that\u2019s 10% of TV coverage, 5% of radio coverage, 4% of online coverage, and only 2% of newspaper coverage. Some argue that the media doesn\u2019t cover women\u2019s sport because there\u2019s not enough demand for it, others that there isn\u2019t more demand because the media doesn\u2019t cover it. Either way, Women In Sport also found that in 2014 only 0.4% of all the commercial investment into sport in Britain was going into women\u2019s sport. Sponsors won\u2019t invest if there\u2019s no exposure, and without marketing, female athletes won\u2019t get the exposure that would increase the demand for coverage.\n\nThese aren\u2019t new arguments, they\u2019ve been running around in circles for years now. Rachael Heyhoe-Flint, who captained England\u2019s cricket team and also worked as a sports journalist, put a version of it in her autobiography way back in 1978. \u201cIt\u2019s all something of a vicious circle. The media will only take notice of minority women\u2019s sports if the sport has the personalities to promote. But until at least one part of the media takes a chance on a sport, who is to know whether the personalities exist or not?\u201d\n\nTo break this spiral, football, rugby and cricket have all set up new women\u2019s Super Leagues. The ECB and the RFU have also started to stage women\u2019s matches alongside men\u2019s games and packaged the two products together in their broadcast rights deals. It\u2019s working. All three tournaments taking place this summer will be shown live. The football is on Channel 4, the rugby is on ITV, and the cricket is on Sky.\n\nEngland\u2019s Euros adventure can deliver glory abroad and lasting impact at home Read more\n\nAs the BBC\u2019s head of sport, Barbara Slater, explained in a recent interview with the Guardian, the audience for the Women\u2019s World Cup rose from 5.1 million in 2011 to 12.4 million in 2015, and that of the latter almost half were, apparently, watching women\u2019s sport for the first time. Slater says that women\u2019s sport makes up 30% of the BBC\u2019s coverage. And Sky, meanwhile, has committed to broadcasting live eight games from the ECB\u2019s Kia Super League, all five majors on the LGPA Tour, England Women\u2019s Six Nations games, and some netball internationals and Superleague matches.\n\nThis feeling that a change is under way is exactly why England\u2019s current cricketers think a little differently about all this to Heyhoe-Flint. \u201cThirteen years ago when I first started playing, all we had was a little bit of lottery funding,\u201d says bowler Jenny Gunn. \u201cNow we\u2019ve come through into the professional era, which is just crazy. I never thought I\u2019d be playing professional cricket. I thought I\u2019d be long retired before it ever happened.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have much coverage, but it\u2019s improved every year. So for me, even though you obviously want more, and you want to see it on free-to-air TV and in all the papers, it is improving so much you can\u2019t really complain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable how far we\u2019ve come in terms of the coverage we get,\u201d says Gunn\u2019s fellow seamer Anya Shrubsole. \u201cThe Ashes series in 2015 was live on Sky and on BBC radio. We had sellout crowds for the games at Chelmsford and Hove. These things would not have happened before, but now they\u2019re becoming much more commonplace. It\u2019s a testament to how far the game has come.\u201d Shrubsole and Gunn were talking at a coaching session for a couple of hundred schoolgirls in Regent\u2019s Park. The ECB has joined up with England Hockey and England Netball in a three-year campaign to increase schoolgirl participation in those three sports, because the hockey World Cup is taking place in London in 2018, and the Netball World Cup in Liverpool in 2019.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Britain\u2019s hockey team won gold at the Olympics last year but would like their sport to be on TV more away from the Games. Photograph: Mark Kolbe/Getty Images\n\nTwo of England\u2019s hockey squad, Sabbie Heesh and Suzy Petty, were also in Regent\u2019s Park. Like the cricketers, they were keen to point out how far their sport has come since they started playing. England Hockey set up a professional programme in 2009, and now has 28 full-time players. \u201cWhen I was 10, it wasn\u2019t possible to get a job in hockey,\u201d Petty says. \u201cI wanted to be an accountant. Then, in 2009, for the first time you could actually do this for a living. It is amazing to be able to tell kids that.\u201d Hockey has its own set of problems. Every four years, at the Olympics, the sport is in the spotlight, then the players have to fight to keep it there till the next Games comes around.\n\n\u201cAs a squad we realise that we\u2019ve got a really good opportunity,\u201d says Petty. \u201cWhen GB won the gold in Rio it meant that hockey, for once, was a sport that people were talking about. I remember going into work after Rio and my boss said to me: \u2018Oh my gosh, your girls!\u2019 I don\u2019t think people realise how good we are.\u201d Petty and Heesh talk about trying to find ways to spread the message outside of the mainstream media. \u201cSocial media is huge \u2013 Instagram, Twitter \u2013 you can have an influence there. Then we\u2019re constantly doing school visits and club visits. But we\u2019re always thinking about how to get the sport on TV. Because that\u2019s the really big thing.\u201d\n\nWomen\u2019s Cricket World Cup: team-by-team guide to the tournament | Vithushan Ehantharajah Read more\n\nThe men will get covered whether they win or lose. The women don\u2019t have that luxury. As Shrubsole says: \u201cAll we can do is keep being successful. Keep winning games, keep winning series, keep winning tournaments.\u201d Which is impossible, because no team wins every game it plays. But England\u2019s women\u2019s cricket team did win the World Cup, in 2009, and the Ashes in 2013 and 2013-14. England\u2019s women\u2019s football team finished third in the 2015 World Cup, England\u2019s women\u2019s rugby team won the World Cup in 2014, and the Six Nations earlier this year, in a grand slam, and Great Britain\u2019s hockey team are, of course, Olympic champions.\n\nSo the women do win, and they still don\u2019t get the sustained coverage they deserve. Which is why Shrubsole says that she\u2019s started to think victory isn\u2019t enough. \u201cBut we also have to win by playing it in a way that makes people want to follow us.

Just a low rumbling at first, it built into a loud roar with hundreds of festivalgoers singing, at the tops of their voices: \u201cOH \u2026 JE-REM-Y COR-BYN.\u201d\n\nGlastonbury this year may boast appearances from the biggest acts in the world, Ed Sheeran and Radiohead among them, but judging by the T-shirts, flags and impromptu musical outbursts, the man of the hour is the Labour party\u2019s 68-year-old leader.\n\nCorbyn is due to make an appearance at the festival on Saturday afternoon, opening for the outspoken hip-hop duo Run the Jewels. It is in a stark contrast to last year, when the politician was forced to cancel a Glastonbury speech after the result of the EU referendum and questions about his future as party leader.\n\nHeather Cuss, 33, from south London, said: \u201cThere\u2019s always a community atmosphere at Glastonbury but this year it\u2019s definitely all about Jezza. We\u2019ve seen musicians playing with Corbyn necklaces and everywhere you walk you hear people break out into Jeremy Corbyn chants. Even bands from abroad have been giving him a shout out as they\u2019ve clearly heard everyone going, \u2018Jeremy Corbyn, Jeremy Corbyn,\u2019 and they\u2019re joining in.\u201d\n\nIn the dance area Shangri-La on Thursday, the New York brass band were leading the crowds in the \u2018Oh, Jeremy Corbyn\u2019 chant and the giant sand sculpture near the park stage was of Corbyn riding on the back of a fox and chasing Theresa May through fields of wheat.\n\nPlay Video 0:20 Glastonbury crowd chant 'Oh, Jeremy Corbyn' at silent disco\n\nThe political antics continued into Friday, when a man dressed as Theresa May in a full red suit and wig was chased through the crowd at the bandstand by eight foxes, to riotous cheers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Corbyn\u2019s biggest fan but he\u2019s become this celebrity icon here,\u201d said Lizzie Gibney, 33, who said that despite her doubts about Corbyn as a leader, she had been heartened by how he had revitalised the youth vote. \u201cGetting out the young vote was an incredible achievement and energising that group of people who hadn\u2019t been targeted by politicians before, and that\u2019s what you really feel being here. Corbyn fever is genuinely everywhere you go.\u201d\n\nOlly, 24, was one of the many festival goers at Worthy Farm, near Pilton, Somerset, sporting a Corbyn T-shirt. \u201cI\u2019m wearing it because Corbyn has put Labour back to where it should have been,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m definitely going to see him talk and will probably do some chanting too.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it seems that this year politicians are the new rock stars. Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls, enjoying his first Glastonbury, was stopped for selfies every five minutes as he walked around Shangri-La and was met with shrieks of delight and songs everywhere he went, to the bemusement of his wife, Yvette Cooper, who hasn\u2019t been to Glastonbury for 30 years.\n\nAndrew Myors, 30, and Matt Foncette, 32, said they had been among those singing the Corbyn when one of the DJs played The White Stripes\u2019 track Seven Nation Army \u2013 the backing music for the chant \u2013 and the whole field erupted into song.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ed Balls (3rd right) and his wife Yvette Cooper (2nd right) waiting in a queue for the showers.

And it\u2019s such a different vibe from last year. I definitely don\u2019t think there were many people singing \u2018woop Brexit\u2019 chants at Shangri La.\u201d\n\nFriday\u2019s headliners are Radiohead, who will be hoping for a slicker performance than their last Glastonbury appearance in 1997. The band described it as the \u201cset from hell\u201d after equipment broke and frontman Thom Yorke almost stormed off during the encore.\n\n'It's bloody brilliant!'

Asked how they intended to last the day, Yuriko said: \u201cNo problem. I never go to the toilet.\u201d\n\nWith the recent terror attacks and political uncertainty after the general election, the mood at Glastonbury was one of defiance and that, while the world outside the festival walls might be crumbling, the spirit of community and hedonism would not be tainted.\n\nLesley Wright, 62 and Shan Shanahan, 54, who have been friends for 15 years and live in the same village in South Wales, were at Glastonbury for the first time, with Wright\u2019s husband who uses an electric wheelchair.

Despite his clearly legible plea, it isn\u2019t to be, and, initially at least, it looks like anyone anticipating anything approaching the greatest hits is out of luck as well.\n\nThe band\u2019s set starts out in remarkably low-key style, the screens either side of the stage turned off, the band playing a lambent piano ballad. When the screens do come on, they\u2019re showing a pretty abstract interpretation of what\u2019s actually happening on stage \u2013 images of Radiohead\u2019s members overlaid with each other, static interference and computer graphics.\n\nIt has an oddly alienating effect. If you can\u2019t see the stage itself, what\u2019s actually going on up there remains something of a mystery, not a state of affairs much improved by Thom Yorke\u2019s unique approach to between-song chat: a Derek and Clive-ish rumination on leylines, some stylised laughter, a suggestion that Theresa May \u201cshut the door on [her] way out\u201d and a mumble about \u201cuseless politicians\u201d that provokes an inevitable chorus of \u201cOh, Jeremy Corbyn\u201d to the tune of Seven Nation Army from the crowd.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Chat \u2026 Thom Yorke\u2019s patter ran from leylines to Theresa May.

But there\u2019s also the sense that the less committed members of the audience are becoming a bit restive.

Among those taking part were Emily Eavis and William Hawk, a Native American from the Standing Rock reservation.\n\nCat Warren, 22, from Bristol, was held aloft on the shoulders of her friends \u2013 all part of a cheerleading team \u2013 to cheers from the crowd.\n\n\u201cThere are worries that things like the attacks in Manchester and London are just going to divide people, and make people more hateful towards minorities,\u201d said Warren. \u201cSo just coming together and celebrating with people from all ages, races and religions, it feels so lovely.

That\u2019s exactly what they want.\u201d\n\nShe was echoed by Martin Goodman, 51, who stood with his wife Lisa, 50, who had driven down from Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s all about togetherness, really,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this climate it feels important to come together and do something positive. The country\u2019s had a hard time and we\u2019ll do anything to try and get it back on its feet. We\u2019re from Manchester so we\u2019ve felt that really close to home but no way that\u2019s going to stop me coming.\u201d\n\nEavis was among those in the human peace sign and the shambolic but spirited event was watched over by Hawk, who led prayers for the victims of the recent tragedies and encouraged the crowd to put their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders to create \u201ca human connection\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need this in our world,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cPeace and love comes about simply by giving peace and love.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Making the peace sign.

We\u2019re just doing it for love.\u201d\n\nSecurity at the 360-hectare (900-acre) festival, which is being headlined by Radiohead, Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran, is tighter than during previous years, and police dogs searched bags for explosives and illegal substances as people entered the site.\n\nIn the run-up to festival season, counter-terrorism chiefs launched a major training drive for festival workers.\n\nThe festival has also arranged special shuttle buses around the site for those who are fearful of crowds after the terrorist attacks. The service has been introduced after Alison Davies, 37, who was at the Ariana Grande concert in Manchester that was hit by a suicide bomber, contacted Glastonbury to express her fears about attending.\n\nIn light of the Grenfell Tower fire, the creators of the late-night dance area Block 9 have put up a plaque clarifying that their installation \u2013 which features a blasted and burnt-out tower block \u2013 was erected before the disaster and any potentially tasteless similarity is \u201cpurely coincidental\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Block 9 installation before the opening of the festival.

We would like to make it clear that any similarity between Grenfell Tower and The London Underground is purely coincidental.\u201d\n\nThe designers Gideon Berger and Stephen Gallagher emphasised that it had been up at the festival for the past seven years. The sign also urged people to make donations to the Red Cross Grenfell Tower Relief Fund donation boxes that will be at the stage bar.\n\nIn an interview with the Glastonbury Free Press, the daily on-site newspaper, Michael Eavis spoke about his desire to make the festival a place where a new way of thinking about the world could flourish.\n\n\u201cI think the fact I love life so much is why I want to preserve it,\u201d said Eavis. \u201cWe have to move heaven and earth now to save this planet. That\u2019s the message I\u2019d like people to take away. But of course the main purpose for being here is to have the best time of their lives.\u201d\n\nDespite queues on Wednesday morning owing to the extra security measures, by Thursday festivalgoers were getting access to the site quickly.\n\nThe extreme heat of Wednesday, which was the hottest day on record at Glastonbury and resulted in nine people being taken to hospital, had also cooled down by the official start of the festival, with light showers in the early morning and thick cloud rolling over.\n\nThe forecast remained variable but bookmakers were offering 2-1 odds that this year could be the driest in festival history."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 18:45:14 GMT", "title": "Rock bottom: Glastonbury makes it the year of the bumbag", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/23/rock-bottom-glastonbury-makes-it-the-year-of-the-bumbag", "text": "It is most definitely the year of the bumbag, if Glastonbury festivalgoers are anything to go by at least.\n\nThere are so many bumbags here: canvas ones covered in Gucci logos; neon pink ones shimmering with sequins; sleek leather ones and practical hi-tech ones; iridescent metallic ones slung over shoulders like holsters.\n\nThat once-maligned accessory, with its associations of paranoid tourists keeping their wallets where they can see them, is having such a moment that the crowd at the Pyramid stage looks like a Mr Motivator convention.\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anoraks and bumbags are ubiquitous at Glastonbury 2017.

This week, though, it is Mrs May herself who has been revealed as Brexit\u2019s empress with no clothes. Everything about her performance in Brussels over the last two days has underlined both the larger national tragedy of Britain\u2019s decision to leave the EU and the deepening personal failure of Mrs May\u2019s attempts to deliver it.\n\nMrs May went to this week\u2019s Brussels summit promising a \u201cfair and serious\u201d offer on the rights of EU citizens in the UK, and of UK citizens in the EU, after Brexit. She met a humiliating response. The EU-27 told her these were not matters for a summit but for the negotiations. Angela Merkel said the proposals were no breakthrough. Emmanuel Macron said there was a long way to go. Even Donald Tusk, often a friend of Britain, called them \u201cbelow expectations.\u201d Meanwhile in Britain, EU citizens\u2019 groups dubbed the plan pathetic, and George Osborne revealed that Mrs May had unilaterally prevented a fairer and more serious offer immediately after the referendum last June because that would strengthen her leadership election chances.\n\nTheresa May makes 'fair and serious' offer on EU citizens rights in UK Read more\n\nThe post-Brexit future of EU citizens in this country, and of our citizens in the EU are widespread concerns across our continent. The uncertainty reaches into thousands of homes and affects millions of lives, especially of young people. Mrs May\u2019s insensitive handling of it is both characteristic and a glumly indicative example of a wider Brexit problem that stretches to every horizon.\n\nMrs May likes to say that 85% of Britons have recently voted for parties committed to Brexit. But this is another clunky line she should stop repeating. The 85% of Britons who voted Tory and Labour on 8 June did not all vote for a Brexit that prioritises heartless immigration controls or spurns the European court of justice. They have certainly not, as Philip Hammond rightly warned this week, voted to become poorer, less secure, or to treat Europe in ways that risk the economy crashing if the talks reach impasse.\n\nBritain\u2019s decision to leave the EU was lamentable when it was taken. It remains lamentable now. If it is ever carried out, it will still be lamentable in the future. That is not going to change. Some things, however, have changed. A year ago, Britain\u2019s decision caused shock among our fellow Europeans. Today, it is more likely to evoke pity. By the time Brexit occurs, if it does, our neighbours\u2019 mood may have turned to derision. Brexit and the US election have energised our neighbours to raise their game. Mr Macron\u2019s election lends momentum to reforms that the UK would back if it had remained. Just when the EU seems to be choosing a more hopeful course, it is Britain, not the EU, that seems left behind by the real world. It was tragic to hear Mrs May talk on Friday of cooperation on terrorism, defence, climate change, trade and migration with good allies that the UK is preparing to abandon.\n\nThe events of the past 12 months, and of the last 48 hours in particular, have provided a vivid lesson in the folly of Brexit. For a year, Mrs May has expended most of her leadership of the Conservative party attempting to forge \u2013 the word is appropriate \u2013 a new deal with the EU that will be worse than the one we now have in every significant respect: economically, socially and culturally. On 8 June, the voters pulled the rug from under her feet. The upshot is a Brexit process that was wrong in the first place, has been badly mishandled, and now lacks credibility at home and in the EU. There is an overwhelming need, and perhaps a burgeoning consensus, for Britain to change its Brexit priorities. We need a closer and more engaged relationship with the EU than the one Mrs May has pursued so ineffectually."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:43:20 GMT", "title": "Boris Johnson for PM?

To win power it needs to do far better, 23 June) follows the Ipsos-Mori analysis on how the country voted. There is no doubt Jeremy Corbyn energised a large number of voters, and not only the young, to support Labour and helped to destroy the Tory Commons majority. However, the increased support tended to come mainly from the more professional and better off.\n\nThe Tories had a marked increase when it came to those on lower incomes etc. The five Labour losses, including mine, would be in this category, but there were similar \u2013 and sometimes larger \u2013 swings to the Tories in other long-held Labour seats, which were absorbed by the previous large majority. There is, as Kettle says, much ground to be covered next time. Labour is usually at its best when it knows electoral victory and progressive legislation are within reach.\n\nDavid Winnick\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 Owen Jones is right about not surrendering ground to the enemy (Labour can\u2019t be complacent: the time to mobilise is now, 22 June), and the period that ended with Jim Callaghan formally renouncing Keynesianism could do with a closer look because the rightwing have made \u201cthe 70s\u201d a pejorative term. We had much greater military costs then as we struggled to quit our empire and still remain a world player. We were still trying to maintain a sterling area. The unions were indeed over-mighty and it was a Labour government in 1969 that tried to introduce reforms without going to the extremes of Thatcher. These were sabotaged by some of Wilson\u2019s own ministers, notably Callaghan.\n\nThe oil shock was a result of our foreign policy. After the Yom Kippur war the Gulf states accused us of knee-jerk support for Israel, as opposed to the Palestinian cause, and tightened the oil taps, causing the price of crude to nearly quadruple. At home, Prime Minister Heath and his chancellor relaxed credit controls and encouraged people to buy houses, resulting in a mini boom and bust. After Denis Healey had gone \u201ccap in hand\u201d to the IMF it was discovered that Whitehall had not done its sums right and we apparently didn\u2019t need as much as we thought, and indeed that debt was paid off pretty quickly. The national debt never got above 50% of GDP during the decade, as opposed to the 85% it stands at after seven years of Tory government.\n\nGiven all this, I don\u2019t believe Keynes\u2019s ideas aren\u2019t still relevant. The mishaps of the 70s mostly stemmed from political and economic choices that are now easily seen. Opinion polls at the time showed high levels of satisfaction with people\u2019s lives, in spite of the upheavals. These were the days, after all, when working people saw secure work, adequate social security, package holidays in the sun and car ownership as their birthright.\n\nDavid Redshaw\n\nGravesend, Kent\n\n\u2022 Notwithstanding the many valid points in his article as he edges back towards relevance in the Corbyn-Labour debate, it is difficult to avoid wondering whether, like Tony Blair, Martin Kettle\u2019s real problem is that he doesn\u2019t want Labour elected on a Corbyn-inspired programme. Of course, Labour must strive to do better \u2013 and some of Kettle\u2019s points are relevant to achieving that.\n\nIt strikes me though that, like the many pre-election critics of Corbyn who refused to acknowledge any comparison with the situation of social democratic parties across Europe, too many former critics still prefer to focus on a negative without considering the wider context and alternatives. It may well be that Gordon Brown\u2019s pollster Deborah Mattinson is correct in saying \u201cmany voters decided to support Labour in spite of Corbyn, not because of him\u201d.\n\nHowever, there should be a parallel assessment of how many of those who turned out to campaign, contribute (like me) and vote because of Corbyn\u2019s manifesto would have done any of those things for a manifesto presented by any of the candidates promoted to supplant Corbyn. Such a holistic analysis would be evidence of goodwill towards the government prospects of both Labour and Corbyn.\n\nJim O\u2019Donnell\n\nBrussels\n\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:36:02 GMT", "title": "Love the idea of a universal basic income?

But animals such as water voles are also harmed, as they are unable to escape predators by fleeing into rivers to reach underwater entrances to their burrows. Birds such as kingfishers, sandpipers and dippers also suffer, as the insects and small fish they feed on die out.\n\nThe rules governing how much water can be taken from rivers have not been updated for more than half a century and take no account of the water needed to sustain the ecological health of rivers. The government published proposed reforms in 2011 and had legislation drawn up early in 2017, but did not find parliamentary time to act.\n\nThe driest October-to-March period for 20 years this year was followed by an extremely dry April and below average rainfall in May, and has left much of Britain with low river and groundwater levels and facing the possibility of drought. The information released to WWF by the Environment Agency shows that in such conditions 23% of England\u2019s rivers could run dry. Further data shows that more than 550 rivers and lakes are in a poor ecological state because too much water is being taken from them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hollowell reservoir, Northamptonshire, during a 2014 drought.

If we have a dry summer, our green and pleasant land could become as parched as some of the Mediterranean,\u201d said Tanya Steele, chief executive of WWF. \u201cThis may sound attractive for sun-seekers, but it would be disastrous for wildlife. But this can be avoided if we update the outdated way we manage the demand on our country\u2019s limited water supplies.\u201d\n\nNew Zealand river granted same legal rights as human being Read more\n\nMany rivers around England have already suffered the effects of over-abstraction of water for agriculture and industry. Peter King, from the Ouse and Adur Rivers Trust in Sussex said: \u201cTwenty years ago you could swim along the Bevern stream \u2013 now you can literally walk across it all year round, as the water levels of the river Ouse have really gone down a lot. The problem is that the rivers have been so badly damaged over the past 50 years that they\u2019re now knackered.\u201d He said this also harmed the local economy: \u201cPeople who visited for canoeing, wildlife and fishing are not visiting anymore.\u201d\n\nEngland hosts most of the world\u2019s chalk streams but these are particularly vulnerable and half are now at risk of drying up, according to WWF. One is the river Chess, which flows through Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire. Paul Jennings, a local farmer and chairman of the River Chess Association, said: \u201cIn the last six years, it has been dry 50% of the time, and this has had devastating effects on the local people.\u201d\n\nIn September 2015, he said, thousands of fish were stranded in small pockets of water when the rest of the river dried up. The local community tried to rescue the fish by collecting them in buckets and moving them downstream, but were unsuccessful.\n\nMany rivers also suffer from sewage and agricultural pollution, with most rivers in England failing to meet EU ecological standards. Simon Ffennell, a horticulturalist who has lived on Hampshire\u2019s river Itchen all his life, said: \u201cThe most noticeable change is the way that the sunny weather in spring combines with the high levels of phosphate and nitrate that is in the river and creates particular algae that is unfortunately smothering the river bed.\u201d\n\nThe problem of over-abstraction of water is exacerbated by the fact that demand for water can double during spells of dry and hot weather, as crops and gardens need more water and people take more showers.\n\nWater companies losing vast amounts through leakage, as drought fears rise Read more\n\nThe Guardian revealed in May that, despite 20% of all piped water being lost to leaks, the level of leakage has not fallen for at least four years. In June, Thames Water was fined a maximum \u00a38.5m for missing its leak reduction targets. Water waste rises to a third of all water taken from the natural environment when losses in treatment plants and in homes and businesses are included.\n\nThe government\u2019s official advisers, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), warned in 2016 that water shortages were one of the most serious impacts of global warming in Britain, with even modest temperature rises leading to \u201csevere\u201d water shortages in England.\n\nProf Ian Barker, from Water Policy International and an adviser to the OECD, said: \u201cAs the climate becomes more uncertain and extreme, and demand for water continues to rise, we need to find a better way to manage scarce water resources. But [UK] proposals to reform water management have been shelved.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: \u201cWe recognise the need to improve water management. That is why we are committed to reforming abstraction licensing into a simplified, modern system that is fairer and more resilient.\u201d\n\nShe said the Environment Agency had made significant changes to more than 250 abstraction licences since 2008, saving 27bn litres of water a year being removed from the environment, enough to supply half a million people with water for one year."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 17:56:54 GMT", "title": "Exeter school\u2019s uniform resolve melts after boys\u2019 skirt protest", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jun/23/exeter-schools-uniform-resolve-melts-after-boys-skirt-protest", "text": "Isca academy in Devon to ditch policy that boys must wear trousers even in a heatwave after \u2018box-pleat rebellion\u2019 caught global attention\n\nThe US constitution has long guaranteed the right to bear arms \u2013 but now the schoolboys of Exeter have gone one better and won the right to bare legs.\n\nBritain\u2019s heatwave this week sparked open rebellion at Isca academy in Devon, with boys wearing skirts in protest at rules that insisted male pupils wear long trousers even as temperatures soared into the mid-30s.\n\nBy the end of the week the school\u2019s icy resolve finally melted in the glare of international exposure.\n\nThe Exeter secondary school has announced that boys will soon be able to choose to wear shorts instead of its tartan trousers, after the \u201cbox-pleat rebellion\u201d caught the attention of media around the world.\n\nAimee Mitchell, the school\u2019s headteacher, sent a message to parents saying that shorts would be allowed \u2013 but only from next school year \u2013 after consulting with pupils and parents.\n\nThe school also confirmed that the boys involved in the protest would not be punished for wearing skirts.\n\nTeenage boys wear skirts to school to protest against 'no shorts' policy Read more\n\n\u201cParents and pupils will be aware that the hot weather these last few days has prompted interest in our school uniform policy, and notably the trousers, rather than shorts, worn by our male students,\u201d the school noted wryly in a \u201chot weather and school uniform update\u201d on its website.\n\n\u201cContrary to news reports, we have not banned shorts; shorts are simply not part of our school uniform.\n\n\u201cHowever, as summers are becoming hotter, shorts will be introduced as part of our school uniform next year having first consulted with students and parents. We feel that introducing a change in uniform partway through this year would put undue pressure on some of our families.\u201d\n\nThe uniform policy became a burning issue as summer warmed up, with the first rebels coming to school in shorts. When male pupils protested that the girls were allowed bare legs, the school said the boys were free to wear skirts if they chose \u2013 and so they did, after borrowing skirts from their sisters and female friends.\n\nRyan Lambeth, a year 10 pupil who was among the ringleaders, told the Exeter Express and Echo: \u201cThey kept telling us off for wearing shorts and I kept getting excluded. It happened three times.\n\n\u201cWe kept talking about wearing skirts and on Tuesday I thought \u2013 right, I\u2019m just going to do it. Then on Wednesday there were five of us. Today there were 50-plus people.\u201d\n\nRyan\u2019s mother, Claire Lambeth, told the Guardian this week: \u201cHe said it was unbearable. I spoke to a teacher to ask about shorts and she said it was school policy [that they could not be worn]. I did say this was exceptional weather, but they were having none of it.\n\n\u201cRyan came up with the idea of wearing a skirt, so that evening we borrowed one. He wore it the next day \u2013 as did five other boys \u2026 I was very proud of Ryan. I think it was a great idea.\u201d\n\nAs the revolution picked up momentum, the world\u2019s media began to take interest. Devon county council staff were called in to help the school handle the flood of inquiries.\n\nBut a spokesperson for the school said it did make concessions to the blistering heat of the past week.\n\n\u201cOur summer uniform allows students not to wear their jumper or blazer. Also, recognising the recent temperatures, students have also been allowed not to wear ties, to have the top button on their shirts undone, and to wear their shirts untucked if they are feeling very hot,\u201d the school said.\n\nKent school head defends sending home girls in too-short skirts Read more\n\nThere is no evidence that the skirted rebellion has caught on outside Devon \u2013 many schools already allow shorts as a summer uniform option, while others have even more options.\n\nLiam Collins, headteacher at Uplands community college in Wadhurst, East Sussex, said his school had a flexible uniform policy, with boys allowed to wear skirts and girls able to wear trousers.\n\n\u201cThis was due to the work that we did with Educate & Celebrate [LGBT charity] and understanding that gender was on a spectrum,\u201d said Collins.\n\n\u201cWe did this work because we had a girl who wanted to change her gender and we were unsure how to support him.

Platt was given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00a32,000 costs and a \u00a320 surcharge.\n\nHe was originally taken to court over a refusal to pay a \u00a3120 penalty for taking his daughter on the unauthorised holiday to Disney World in Florida in 2015. Local magistrates found there was no case to answer and two high court judges upheld their decision, saying Platt had not acted unlawfully because his daughter had a good attendance record.\n\nBut the supreme court disagreed in April, saying that the definition of failure to attend regularly was not in an \u201cevenly spaced\u201d manner or \u201csufficiently often\u201d, but \u201cin accordance with the attendance rules\u201d.\n\nGiving her judgment on Friday, magistrate Jeannie Walker said: \u201cThe circumstances of this case fall squarely into that breach of school rules,\u201d adding that the council had \u201cproved beyond reasonable doubt that the child was not attending school regularly on those dates of the holiday\u201d.\n\nSumming up his case, Isle of Wight council\u2019s lawyer Ben Rich had cited the supreme court\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\nPlatt\u2019s lawyer, Paul Greatorex QC, argued that the prosecution had not \u201cproduced any evidence as to what the school rules are. There\u2019s nothing in writing. What are the school rules? Who knows? They are not there.\u201d\n\nThe court had previously heard that the case should be thrown out, as Platt\u2019s lawyers argued that pursuing legal action against him amounted to an \u201cabuse of process\u201d. They said Platt had been told his daughter\u2019s attendance was satisfactory and that he had not seen documents setting out a new school policy in which term-time holidays were no longer allowed.\n\n\n\nBut the lawyer for Isle of Wight council argued that the school was not required to make sure that every letter sent home was read, and that the council\u2019s code of conduct had also made it plain that a penalty notice could be issued for a term-time holiday.\n\nBefore Friday\u2019s ruling, it was revealed that the government had spent \u00a3139,891.93 up to 10 May on fighting Platt in court. A freedom of information request by the Press Association revealed that the Department for Education spent \u00a353,655 on high court and supreme court cases and reimbursed Isle of Wight council \u00a386,237, including \u00a314,631 to cover Platt\u2019s high court costs, which the council had been ordered to cover.\n\nPlatt said he had spent close to \u00a330,000 on fighting the case, with additional funds covered by legal aid. He said the case would have implications for parents around the country.\n\n\u201cThere were around 8.5m unauthorised absences around the country in a single term.

Routine arming is controversial within policing and many do not support it.\n\nBut it may also mark the start of a shift in thinking on the topic, which could speed up in the event of any future attacks. Also up for discussion, sources say, is the introduction of more specially trained armed officers in cars, and offering handguns to some patrol officers as well as the idea that all frontline officers could be offered training to carry a gun.\n\n\n\nTraditionally, most police in Great Britain are unarmed \u2013 unlike their counterparts in Northern Ireland \u2013 but police sources say the longstanding principle is under pressure after four terrorist attacks in three months.\n\nOne of the reasons the topic is on the agenda is concern over how some areas \u2013 particularly those outside London \u2013 would cope with a marauding terrorist attack.\n\nOne option in the paper for getting armed officers more quickly to the scene of an attack is for officers to be offered a sidearm, like officers in the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\n\nThe paper also suggests that beat officers who are now unarmed would get about two weeks of training in how to use a handgun. That is much less training than the six weeks for fully qualified armed officers.\n\n\n\nThe beat officers would then get a day of refresher training and re-accreditation twice a year. The upside of this option is that police chiefs might get enough officers volunteering, and it would boost the number of officers who can handle a gun in a crisis more quickly than other options.\n\n\n\nHowever, handguns cost \u00a3500 each, and training would further stretch resources, as officers would have to take time off to train.\n\nA spokesperson for the NPCC said: \u201cThese are early-stage discussions, not yet at a phase of formal proposals. Also, any decision regarding arming patrol officers would be subject to extensive threat and risk assessments to ensure it was justified by the nature of the threat.\n\n\u201cOur goal at this stage is to have a mature and considered discussion about armed policing with the government, PCCs [police and crime commissioners], and [police] chiefs.\u201d\n\nThe author of the discussion paper is Simon Chesterman, the national police lead on firearms.\n\nBut those behind the discussion point to the fact that in the 2013 terrorist murder of Lee Rigby, in Woolwich, south London, unarmed police were unable to intervene until their armed colleagues arrived on the scene. One source added: \u201cIt will allow officers to access a firearm in the event of an attack.\u201d\n\n\n\nUntil now, the preferred option was for highly trained armed officers to be deployed, patrolling the streets in armed response vehicles (ARVs), and ready to be sent to the scene of attack. But the problem is that it might not be possible to get such a unit to the scene of a terror attack on time, particularly outside the capital.\n\nAt the council meeting, the police chiefs will be asked to consider how they would deal with a London Bridge-style attack. If they think it would take too long to send enough armed officers to the scene, they are asked to consider whether it would make sense to increase their number of armed response vehicles or to arm frontline officers.\n\nLondon is thought to have enough armed officers to rush to the scene of an attack. In the case of London Bridge, it took eight minutes for officers to find and kill the three terrorists, who were attacking people with knives.\n\nThe Westminster attack in March saw about 50 armed officers on the scene in 11 minutes, although in that instance the attacker was stopped because an armed protection officer happened to be in the grounds of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nThere has already been one drive to increase the number of fully trained armed officers, after the Paris attacks in November 2015. That effort is on target, but only just, and some senior officers now believe it insufficient.\n\nLegally, police chiefs in the 43 forces across England and Wales are operationally independent, and any decision about the arming of officers is formally for them and their police and crime commissioners, although any significant change would be a matter of political debate.\n\nIn a recent survey of Met officers, the Metropolitan Police Federation found just over half said they would carry a gun routinely if asked to do so. One in 10 said they would quit rather than carry a firearm.\n\n"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 06:00:00 GMT", "title": "Family of London man who died after arrest demand answers", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/24/family-of-london-man-who-died-after-arrest-demand-answers", "text": "Edir Frederico Da Costa died in hospital on Wednesday six days after being apprehended by police and falling unwell\n\nThe family of a man who died following his arrest in London last week have demanded answers after the police watchdog said a postmortem contradicted their claim that he suffered a series of severe injuries.\n\nEdir Frederico Da Costa, commonly known as Edson, died in hospital on Wednesday, six days after his arrest in east London by Metropolitan police officers.\n\nScotland Yard said on the night of the arrest that the 25-year-old had been taken unwell after being detained and that they believed he had \u201cswallowed a large quantity of drugs\u201d.

George Osborne, when he was chancellor, had taken the matter to the court to fight an attempt by the ECB to argue that clearing houses \u2013 such as the LCH \u2013 should be based in the eurozone when they handle trades in euros. In 2015, the general court of the EU had ruled that the ECB did not have the power to demand such a move.\n\nThe euro clearing issue is one of many competitive threats to the City in the wake of the Brexit vote.

However, MPs said privately they had serious concerns about a prominent and outspoken Brexiter chairing the committee during the EU negotiations, when the economy was one of the most crucial issues.\n\nRees-Mogg told the Financial Times he would work to achieve consensus on the committee if selected. \u201cThe chairman of a select committee should balance his views against the views of the rest of the committee,\u201d he told the paper. \u201cCommittees only work if members of it want to achieve a consensus report.\u201d\n\nMorgan wrote to MPs on Friday to ask for their support for the role, which will be decided by secret ballot in the coming weeks. \u201cClearly the major issue in the parliament will be the government\u2019s Brexit negotiations,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cIt will be the role of all backbench MPs to hold ministers to account on behalf of our constituents ...

Now we have started tattooing avocados as retailers battle to feed the UK\u2019s growing obsession with the creamy green fruit.\n\nFruit supplier Mack, based in Kent, handles 1.3m avocados a week for a number of British retailers, and is testing a new Spanish-developed machine for labelling fruit destined for Marks & Spencer\u2019s shelves.\n\nCardboard trays of avocados go into a large square contraption and, a few dancing sparks and puffs of smoke later, they emerge the other side with the M&S logo, best before date, country of origin and a till code burned into their skin like an ink-free tattoo.\n\nThe British chain hopes to save 10 tonnes of labels and backing paper and five tonnes of adhesive every year by using these lasered labels rather than stickers.\n\nCharlie Curtis, fruit technologist at M&S, adds that laser labelling is also more reliable than stickers which have a tendency to fall off the wrinkly and often slightly damp skins.\n\nSo what if the poor buy avocados \u2013 everybody deserves a little luxury | Emma Brockes Read more\n\nLast year M&S sold 12m avocados and sales this year are up more than 29%.\n\n\n\nAdam Shaw, a technical manager at Mack, said demand for avos was rising so fast \u2013 \u201cand we don\u2019t see it stopping any time soon\u201d \u2013 that the firm has had to add four new specialist ripening rooms for the fruit, taking its total to 16.\n\nEnsuring avocados are ready for mashing on to your breakfast toast is not an easy business. The fruits arrive in the UK graded by size but unripe and hard. They then go into the ripening rooms where they are wafted with warm air for five days.\n\nThey are then tested to ensure the avocados are ripe enough for packing: a few sample fruits are stripped of their skin and a gadget called a penetrometer or a fruit texture analyser is used to measure hardness.\n\nA more automated system is on trial which can test lots of fruit by tapping it and listening to the echo. But the system is not yet perfect \u2013 Shaw says it needs tweaking so that it can work on fruits with different sizes of stone.\n\nThe human touch, however, is still required. Once ripened, the avocados are cooled and hand checked by a group of expert avocado feelers who can tell if a fruit is ripe and ready by just holding and looking at it, but never bruising it.\n\nHoly guacamole! Avocado fans in UK face further price rises Read more\n\nAvoiding waste is becoming more important as it has been harder than usual to source avocados this summer and prices have risen. The wholesale price of avocados in the UK has more than doubled from 37.5p in January to 77.5p this week, according to analysts at Mintec.\n\nFruit from Peru and South Africa is usually in ready supply at this time of year. But supplies have tightened after a late harvest in Mexico, flooding in Peru and drought in California. Strikes by workers in Mexico, which accounts for up to 70% of global avocado production, have added to the problems.\n\nAlso 2017 is a \u201cdown year\u201d for the crop: avocados naturally alternate between good and poor years for harvest yields.\n\nShaw said the company has turned to new sources of supply in Colombia as it has become more difficult to meet demand for a fruit which has overtaken berries as its fastest growing product.\n\n\n\n\u201cAvailability has been tough and the rise in demand from the far east and Asia has also played a part. There is global demand for this fruit,\u201d he said.\n\nBack in the Mack packhouse M&S will soon start more laser trials : avocados, they say, may be just the beginning. The Spanish Laser Food company, which makes the branding machines, has already tested its technology on other kinds of fruit and veg including melons, pumpkins and nectarines.\n\nAnd M&S has big plans to use the tattoo technology for fun rather than just cost saving reasons - like drawing spooky faces on pumpkins to make it easier for shoppers to cut out Halloween lanterns, and to put smileys on nectarines to make them more appealing to children."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:40:28 GMT", "title": "Risk of air accidents up after CAA cost-cutting, leaked report warns", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/23/risk-of-air-accidents-in-uk-up-after-caa-cost-cutting-warns-leaked-report", "text": "Draft Civil Aviation Authority report criticised failings, including in monitoring of flight training and licensing of pilots\n\nCost-cutting and an overstretched workforce at the Civil Aviation Authority have increased the risk of air accidents in Britain, according to a leaked internal report drafted by the air safety regulator but never released.\n\nInspectors at the CAA, which oversees flight safety, warned bosses that they did not have the resources to do their job properly, the draft report shows.\n\nThere were \u201csignificant weaknesses\u201d in the CAA\u2019s safety division, including the monitoring of flight training and the licensing of pilots, the report said.\n\nThe provisional report \u2013 produced by the CAA\u2019s head of strategy and safety assurance at the request of senior directors but never published \u2013 warned that the problems it identified were \u201cthose most likely to feature as contributory causal factors in aircraft accidents\u201d.\n\nA staff survey detailed within the report showed that fewer than 10% of employees believed their colleagues had time to undertake important safety activities to an acceptable standard.\n\nFewer than 20% of staff agreed that all of the organisation\u2019s important safety functions were adequately covered and that activities were \u201csufficient to assure ourselves that we are protecting the safety of the public\u201d.\n\nDamning findings in the safety assurance review included:\n\n\u2022 A large number of licences issued to pilots contained errors.\n\n\n\n\u2022 The CAA was failing to properly oversee flight training organisations.\n\n\u2022 \u201cSignificant staff reductions \u2026 have led in some cases to insufficient access to expertise.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Important safety activities required by the European Aviation Safety Agency (the EU regulator) were \u201csignificantly behind schedule\u201d.\n\n\u2022 The CAA\u2019s \u201ccapability does not match the true demands\u201d.\n\nThe review and survey was proposed by the CAA\u2019s safety action group and commissioned by safety director Mark Swan, amid a shakeup of the CAA.\n\nThe group proposed the review \u201cto ensure that the organisation continued to be fit for purpose to deliver effective safety oversight\u201d.\n\nWhile the review rated the overall fitness for purpose of the safety division as \u201cadequate\u201d, it found that \u201cin all areas reviewed, there is evidence that the resources available \u2026 are at minimum levels.

Six days after Trump joined Riyadh in denouncing Qatar as a \u201cfunder of terrorism at a very high level\u201d, Mattis signed a $12bn arms deal with the Qataris.\n\nThe state department issued a stinging rebuke of the behaviour of the Saudis and their Egyptian, Emirati and Bahraini allies, with the secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, warning them to make their demands on Qatar \u201creasonable and actionable\u201d.\n\nNow that the list of 13 demands has been presented and Qatar has been given 10 days to comply, much will depend on what is seen as being reasonable and actionable.\n\nOn Thursday, state spokeswoman Heather Nauert would not be drawn on the question. \u201cI think that they [the Gulf protagonists] will know exactly what things are reasonable and what things are actionable,\u201d she said.\n\nIn reality, both sides in the dispute are accustomed to looking to the US for guidance. However, guidance from Washington has seldom been less clear.\n\nDifferent parts of the US executive have often had very different approaches to foreign policy problems. During the Obama administration, for example, the White House was far more risk-averse and non-interventionist than the Pentagon and the state department over Syria. But rarely, if ever, have the disagreements been so open, and the signalling so chaotic. The result has been to increase the risk of miscalculation in an already dangerous row.\n\nThe immediate crisis can be traced back directly to Trump\u2019s first trip abroad as president, to Riyadh on 20 May, when he was feted and showered with flattery. Trump vaunted Saudi leadership and decisively sided with the Sunni Gulf states against Iran. Less publicly, Trump appears tacitly or explicitly to have given the green light to the Saudi royals to go on the offensive against its truculent neighbour.\n\nWhen the Qatar blockade was declared, Trump cheered it on in tweets, triggering alarm and countervailing moves from the Pentagon and state department.\n\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to a rational policy process, or if there is, it seems to exclude the president Daniel Drezner, Tufts University\n\n\u201cThe general ambience in the White House is that they are in line with Saudi, the UAE and the others,\u201d a source in the Trump camp familiar with foreign and security policy said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be leading this \u2013 this is an Arab Gulf matter \u2013 but they are backing it.\n\n\u201cThen came the signing of that deal with Qatar with DoD [Department of Defense]. That was the first sign that things were different from what we thought.\n\n\u201cThe difference seems to be very wide between the position of the White House and the statement made out of Foggy Bottom. It makes it look like there is a foreign policy, but there is an opposition to that foreign policy. That is really peculiar. It\u2019s unexpected.\u201d\n\nThe dissonance on policy toward Russia and Ukraine is equally striking, and was illustrated by the visit to Washington this week by the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. He had been led to believe that he would have a White House meeting with Trump, which would solidify his standing in the continuing conflict with eastern Ukraine separatists and their Moscow backers.\n\nBy the time Poroshenko left Kiev, the meeting had still not been confirmed. The White House was insisting that Poroshenko would only be meeting Vice-President Mike Pence, which would be a significant snub. It was only after persistent pressure from the national security adviser, HR McMaster, that a compromise was found. Pence and Poroshenko would \u201cdrop in\u201d briefly on Trump and McMaster.\n\nEven then, the president, who is reported to be personally under investigation over ties to Moscow, did not offer words of support or criticism of Russia\u2019s aggression, describing Ukraine noncommittally as \u201ca place that we\u2019ve all been very much involved in. And you\u2019ve been seeing it, and everybody\u2019s been reading about it\u201d.\n\nIt was only when Poroshenko arrived at the Pentagon that he received a clear gesture of US support, delivered by Mattis, who told him: \u201cWe support you in the face of threats to sovereignty, to international law or to the international order.\u201d\n\nIvo Daalder, former US ambassador to Nato and now head of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, said it was \u201cnot unheard of for the Pentagon and/or the state department to be out of synch with the White House on foreign policy.\n\n\u2018The war after Isis\u2019: has Trump opened the door to conflict with Iran?

At any time after she said no, did her attacker stop having sex with her, then penetrate her once again?\n\nYes, Palmer said.\n\n\u201cOK,\u201d the detective replied, according to Palmer. \u201cThat\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nBill Cosby plans to teach young people how to not get accused of sexual assault Read more\n\nIt was important because in North Carolina, a person cannot withdraw consent for sex once intercourse is taking place. Because of a 1979 state supreme court ruling that has never been overturned, continuing to have sex with someone who consented then backed out isn\u2019t considered to be rape.\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d Palmer told the Guardian. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nThe North Carolina law is an example of how the US legal system has not always kept pace with evolving ideas about rape, sex and consent. Just last year, an Oklahoma court ruled that the state\u2019s forcible sodomy statute did not criminalize oral sex with a victim who is completely unconscious. The toughest charge available to prosecutors was unwanted touching.\n\nBut the North Carolina law appears to be unique. And it has shocked even those who are used to dealing with such legalistic vagaries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d said John Wilkinson, a former prosecutor and an adviser to AEquitas, a group which helps law enforcement pursue cases of sexual violence. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could find anyone today to agree with this notion that you cannot withdraw consent. People have the right to control their own bodies. If sex is painful, or for whatever reason, they have the right to change their mind.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t think you could find anyone today to agree with this notion that you cannot withdraw consent John Wilkinson, former prosecutor\n\nThe ruling has devastated victims and frustrated prosecutors in North Carolina for years. State senator Jeff Jackson, who has introduced legislation to amend the law, encountered a similar case when he was a criminal prosecutor. His office was ultimately forced to dismiss the rape charge.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is the only state in the country where no doesn\u2019t really mean no,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe have a clear ethical obligation to fix this obvious defect in our rape law.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis May, another North Carolina woman, Amy Guy, revealed that the law had prevented prosecutors from charging her husband with rape, after a violent attack in which she repeatedly resisted.\n\nGuy was estranged from her husband when he showed up unannounced at her new home and demanded she sleep with him. Her husband had been violent in the past, Guy said, so she consented. When he began to hurt her, she told him to stop. He did not.\n\nA rape conviction could have carried a prison sentence of five and a half to nearly seven years, according to Guy\u2019s attorney. But once somebody in the prosecutor\u2019s office recalled the 1979 ruling, law enforcement allowed Guy\u2019s husband to plead guilty to a lesser charge, of misdemeanor assault, for being violent during their encounter.\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d Guy said in an interview. \u201cThat did not make any sense. I was taught that no means no and it\u2019s not really true.\u201d\n\nHe was given a sentence of 10 months and is due to be released in November.\n\n\u2018No one can seriously defend this loophole\u2019\n\nThe 1979 ruling, State v Way, arose after a man named Donnie Leon Way appealed his recent conviction for second-degree rape. Way was convicted of using extreme violence to force an acquaintance to submit to rape and oral sex. Wilkinson, the AEquitas adviser, said he was confounded as to why the state supreme court even introduced the idea of withdrawing consent.\n\n\u201cNo one can seriously defend this loophole,\u201d Jackson said in his statement. His bill would amend state law to read, in part: \u201cA person may withdraw consent to engage in vaginal intercourse in the middle of the intercourse, even if the actual penetration is accomplished with consent and even if there is only one act of vaginal intercourse \u2026\n\n\u201cA defendant who continues the act of vaginal intercourse after consent is withdrawn is deemed to have committed the act of vaginal intercourse by force and against the will of the other person.\u201d\n\nThe proposal is stuck in committee with no sign that lawmakers will try to pass it before the current legislative session ends.\n\nPalmer\u2019s case, however, has put the decades-old ruling back in the spotlight.\n\nThe person she says attacked her has not been arrested or charged. Palmer wonders if that is because it would be difficult to prove he penetrated her multiple times, after she told him to stop. In his defense, she reasons, he could say she consented at the beginning of intercourse and they only had sex once.\n\nI was taught that no means no and it\u2019s not really true Amy Guy\n\nA Fayetteville police spokesperson did not respond to a message asking if the 1979 ruling had any influence on law enforcement\u2019s decision not to bring rape charges. Police have told Palmer and the Fayetteville Observer, which first publicized her case, that the evidence they collected wasn\u2019t enough to substantiate a rape.\n\nPalmer agreed to be identified by name to create awareness of her case.\n\nOn a Saturday in January, according to Palmer and court documents, she and a friend went to Fort Bragg to connect with men they met on Tinder Social. After Palmer and her friend split up, Palmer went to a party in an apartment complex where she met the man she identifies as her assailant.\n\nIn an emptier apartment, she recalled, he pulled her into a bathroom to have sex. But when he began to grab her hair so hard that she could feel it ripping out, she told him he was hurting her and he had to stop. He told her to be quiet and relax, Palmer said. He didn\u2019t stop.\n\nPalmer said she repeated her demand several more times, but he never relented. Fighting back seemed dangerous: \u201cArmy guys are trained in physical combat,\u201d she said.\n\nI recreated my rape scene to show why sexual consent lessons are crucial | Alice Irving Read more\n\nDuring the ordeal, she said, she saw at least one camera phone that had been slipped under the bathroom door, apparently to make a recording. Four soldiers stationed at Fort Bragg were later charged with creating or possessing video recordings of the incident.\n\nThe following Monday, Palmer submitted to a rape kit and gave police the clothes she had worn that night.\n\nBut Fayetteville police did not charge the man Palmer says raped her. Palmer believes they waited too long to collect vital evidence.

They found Dawes and Virgilio Rosales, her partner, sleeping in a Dodge SUV she had purchased a month earlier, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe vehicle had been reported stolen, though Dawes did not know this and thought she had purchased it legitimately, the court filing states. It adds that when the officers approached the SUV with flashlights, Dawes was startled and tried to reverse the car. A police vehicle drove into her path, causing a minor collision.\n\nThe lawsuit states: \u201cDawes still unaware of what was going on or who was blocking her path, pulled her vehicle forward so she could have a clear path to back up. As Dawes backed up her vehicle at a very slow rate of speed, defendants Hess and Kimpel fired at least 13 shots through the passenger side window, striking Dawes four times in the neck, her right tricep, left arm, upper left chest and right forearm.\n\nWe are happy that there may be some justice in this case because the death of Genevive was definitely preventable Daryl Washington, attorney\n\n\u201cDawes\u2019s right earlobe was also partially amputated.

The list of demands also called for other Doha-supported news outlets to be shut, including the New Arab and Middle East Eye.\n\nOther key demands mapped out by Saudi include Qatar severing all ties with terrorist groups, specifically the Muslim Brotherhood, Islamic State, al-Qaida and Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah. The ultimatum calls for the handing over of designated terrorists and other individuals by Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt and Bahrain. All contacts with the political opposition inside Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain would have to be halted with all files handed over that detail Qatar\u2019s prior contacts with, and support for, opposition groups.\n\nQatar\u2019s links with Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s main adversary, would have to be confined only to trade allowed under the international sanctions regime and approved by the Gulf Co-operation Council.\n\nCutting ties to Iran would prove incredibly difficult \u2013 Qatar shares with Iran a massive offshore natural gas field, which supplies the small nation that will host the 2022 Fifa World Cup with much of its wealth.\n\n\n\nHuman cost of the Qatar crisis: 'families are being torn apart' Read more\n\nQatar insists it does not fund terrorists, and has previously said that the embargo is a punishment for following an independent foreign policy more sympathetic to the principles of the Arab spring than that of its neighbours.\n\nQatar would also be required to accept monthly external audits after agreeing to the demands, then once per quarter during the second year. It would also have to agree to be monitored annually for compliance for 10 years.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defence minister rejected suggestions that Doha should review its military base in Qatar and said demands for its closure represent interference in Ankara\u2019s relations with the Gulf state.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, before the 13 demands were tabled, Qatar\u2019s foreign minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, said his country had always abided by international laws and played a key role in the international coalition fighting Isis.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sabrina Siddiqui in Washington\n\nThe 13 demands in full"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 19:38:53 GMT", "title": "Teen killed by stray bullet while police fire at dog during response to 'loud music'", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/23/armando-garcia-muro-police-shooting-stray-bullet-dog-la", "text": "Los Angeles sheriff\u2019s deputies said they accidentally shot and killed a teenager while firing bullets at a dog during a response to a noise complaint, marking the latest killing by US police to spark national outrage.\n\nOfficers were responding to a call about \u201cloud music\u201d early Thursday morning when a pit bull charged at the deputies and bit one of them, according to authorities in California.

The success of the women\u2019s team was in stark contrast to the fortunes of the men\u2019s team at the time \u2013 England had just lost the Ashes on home soil under Graham Gooch \u2013 and the 24-year-old captain, standing in the shadow of the Lord\u2019s pavilion, proudly boasted that the men \u201ccould learn a few things\u201d from her side.\n\nNearly a quarter of a century on, the former captain, in joyfully candid mood, hides her face in her hands and cringes. \u201cI was young and I thought: \u2018I\u2019m going to milk this,\u2019\u201d she laughs. Her team had, after all, been rank outsiders in the final, having collapsed pathetically against New Zealand in their second match. Yet a week and a half after that loss, England defeated the same side at Lord\u2019s and she became the first England cricketer \u2013 man or woman \u2013 to lead her team to victory in a World Cup final.\n\n\n\nTwenty years later the tournament is returning to England. England\u2019s women have not won the trophy since 1993, but expectations will certainly be high this summer. Women\u2019s cricket has changed beyond recognition since the days when players still bought their own kit; and in the past decade, under the oft-victorious leadership of Charlotte Edwards, the England team has led the world in professionalism.\n\n\n\nIsabelle Duncan, author of a recent history of women\u2019s cricket, admits that it is tempting, having counted the vast strides the women\u2019s game has made, to imagine it only in terms of the recent past. \u201cYou tend to think women\u2019s cricket started two minutes ago, but the depth of the history surprises everybody,\u201d she says.\n\n\n\nNo more underarm tactics Facebook Twitter Pinterest Female Cricket Team circa 1875. Photograph: General Photographic Agency/Getty Images\n\nA women\u2019s cricket team, circa 1875\n\nOne of cricket\u2019s most famous pieces of folklore concerns Christina Willis, who used to play with her brother John \u2013 a Kent player in the early 19th century \u2013 in their garden. Her hooped skirt made it impossible for her to bowl the ball underarm, as was the norm, so she would deliver the ball from waist-high \u2013 a style that later became known as \u201cround-arm bowling\u201d and was the precursor of the overarm bowling that exists today. Her son Edward later wrote: \u201cThere was a saying that Willis, his sister, and his dog could beat any eleven in England.\u201d\n\nWomen were involved in the game even earlier than this, however. A painting from 1344 \u2013 considered, by some, to be one of the earliest known records of the game \u2013 shows what appears to be medieval mixed cricket: a nun, holding a ball, apparently about to bowl at a monk with a stick. Four hundred years later, the sport had descended from these saintly heights and was a magnet for gambling, but even then women were central to the action: a game involving Sussex Women at the Honourable Artillery Company in 1747 had to be abandoned for the day after it caused a riot among the spectators.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest 1888: Participants in a ladies cricket match between Harrow and Pinner. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nThe irony is that women\u2019s cricket at this time was not only highly popular, but, for a short while at least, professional. In 1890 two Balham-based teams known as the Original English Lady Cricketers (OELC) toured Britain, playing exhibition matches to crowds of 15,000 or more. The first game played at Headingley (Yorkshire\u2019s county ground and Test match venue) is thought to have been between the OELC\u2019s \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d teams.\n\n\u201cBut it goes downhill from there,\u201d says Duncan. \u201cWomen were practically locked up behind high walls at school, cricket wasn\u2019t considered becoming for a lady, and the industrial revolution put a stop to the game among the working classes, because they were too tired to play. Everybody became prudish and it went completely backwards. There were still some very talented women, like WG Grace\u2019s daughter, Betty, but then he himself stopped her playing. She left school never to play again \u2013 it was just criminal! But those were the prevailing attitudes.\u201d\n\n\n\nInternational openings\u00ad\u00ad Facebook Twitter Pinterest Betty Snowball and Myrtle Maclagan walk out to bat. Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images\n\nBetty Snowball and Myrtle Maclagan\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the 1930s that the first women\u2019s international match was played. Myrtle Maclagan and Betty Snowball, England\u2019s opening bats, were considered the female equivalent of Hobbes and Sutcliffe, the greatest opening pair in Test history, and their matches were keenly followed. After the men had lost the Ashes at home in 1934, the 23-year-old debutant Maclagan, who had taught herself to bowl off-spin, took seven wickets for 10 runs against Australia in the first innings of the first ever women\u2019s Test match in Brisbane.\n\nA mighty strategist, and true all-round talent, she finished the three-match series with 253 runs and 20 wickets, inspiring the Morning Post to publish the following poem:\n\n\n\nWhat matter that we lost, mere nervy men Since England\u2019s women now play England\u2019s game? Wherefore, immortal Wisden, take your pen And write MACLAGAN on the scroll of fame.\n\nSnowball, meanwhile, put her wristy square cut to good use when England travelled on to New Zealand, and scored 189 runs in 222 minutes, the kind of fast-paced innings that would give Ben Stokes or Jonny Bairstow a run for their money.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Enid Bakewell batting.

In the 1960s Enid Bakewell, one of the greatest all-rounders the game has produced, was selling chocolate on the boundary at Trent Bridge to raise money. Try to imagine a world-class male player doing the same.\n\n\n\nBakewell\u2019s name is less celebrated than that of the woman who captained her, Rachael Heyhoe Flint. But the Nottinghamshire player, who had modelled her spin bowling action on the famous Tony Lock, was a major factor in England\u2019s success under Heyhoe Flint, and had the same gritty, never-surrender spirit. She would bowl for two hours in the nets without ever stopping for so much as a sip of water and her hard-nosed, no-compromise approach caused her problems at home. When she joined her first England tour in 1968-69 she had to miss Christmas with her two-year-old daughter and leave her at home for three months; her husband once threatened to leave her if she didn\u2019t curtail the away-games travel, and got as far as packing his bags, but \u201ccame back for Sunday lunch\u201d.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s invincibles Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rachael Heyhoe Flint holds the World Cup trophy in 1973. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images\n\nRachael Heyhoe Flint holds the World Cup trophy\n\nThe era of Heyhoe Flint and Bakewell is rightly remembered as a time of invincibility for England\u2019s women. Heyhoe Flint was unbeaten in Tests in her 12-year reign, which began in 1966, and her stamina both on and off the pitch \u2013 where she was tireless in promoting the cause of the women\u2019s game \u2013 was inspirational; over 22 years she made a record 51 appearances for England in all forms of the game. But not all the cricket her team played was exciting to watch. Heyhoe Flint famously scored the first six in a women\u2019s international match, but she could also grind out a merciless draw.\n\n\u201cThat was the way they played,\u201d says Duncan. \u201cIt was pretty boring, there was a slow over rate and of course the players weren\u2019t trained so they weren\u2019t so athletic. Heyhoe Flint was thought of as very successful because she didn\u2019t lose matches, even if she didn\u2019t win them. She would bat for eight hours in a war of attrition. But that was the style of the place, and the state of the pitches \u2013 it was often equally boring in the men\u2019s game too.\u201d\n\n\n\nHeyhoe Flint not only instigated the Women\u2019s Cricket World Cup \u2013 with the help of Wolverhampton businessman Jack Hayward, who backed it to the tune of \u00a340,000 \u2013 but led her team to victory in its debut year. Bakewell\u2019s century in the final round-robin game of the tournament left Australia with a mountain they were unable to climb.\n\nIt was also thanks to Heyhoe Flint\u2019s indefatigable campaigning that the England women were finally allowed to play a match at Lord\u2019s, in 1976, nearly two centuries after the ground was inaugurated. (They still weren\u2019t welcome in the hallowed Long Room \u2013 it took another 30 years before Heyhoe was finally allowed into the Lord\u2019s pavilion in her own right, as an MCC member.)\n\n\n\nIt was hard, when Heyhoe Flint retired, for her successors to live up to her forthright leadership. Both Carole Hodges and Jan Brittin, appointed during England\u2019s lean spell in the 1980s, were introverts and, as Smithies puts it, \u201cnot natural leaders of people\u201d. A succession of defeats caused antagonism within the team and a hard-bitten Australian side, under Chrissy Matthews, became the dominant force in women\u2019s cricket.\n\n\n\nPart-time players, professional demands Facebook Twitter Pinterest Karen Smithies is presented with the World Cup. Photograph: Patrick Eagar/Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images\n\nKaren Smithies is presented with the World Cup\n\nAlthough the World Cup win in 1993 restored some confidence, the England women\u2019s team were then expected to behave like professional sportspeople while juggling their unpaid training with the demands of family life and full-time jobs: Smithies, who had grown up in a Leicestershire mining community, worked for a bookmaking firm; Jo Chamberlain was a van driver; and Brittin was an air stewardess. Former player Sarah Potter called for change. \u201cThe sport in England staggers along in unnoticed crisis,\u201d she wrote in the Times.\n\nAs the international scene grew, so did the kinds of problems the England women encountered. In 1986, India\u2019s touring side demanded that vehicles in the car park \u2013 allegedly dazzling their bowlers \u2013 were removed. The umpires were toothless, the over rate slowed to eight an hour, and the match fizzled out to a draw, with England unable to knock off the final 25 runs.\n\n\n\nAnd on a return tour in 1995, Smithies recalls, England found themselves confined to their rooms for two days before a match because, amid the general election fever in Guwahati, a gunman had allegedly threatened to kill the team.\n\nIt was a fractious tour containing many controversial umpiring decisions, and it made their dramatic Test victory in Jamshedpur \u2013 Chamberlain trapping India\u2019s last bat lbw with the home team trailing by just two runs \u2013 especially sweet.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Claire Taylor of England.

Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images\n\nClaire Taylor and Isa Guha\n\nSmithies recalls an earlier decision in the game: \u201cIt was the first game I didn\u2019t walk \u2013 we were in a tricky position on the third day, and we felt pretty hard done by. I nicked one, and I remember Sue Metcalf saying to me: \u2018Smithers, you hit the leather off that.\u2019 I felt very guilty.\u201d\n\nIn 1998, with English cricket undergoing a radical overhaul, it was recognised that the women needed more financial and administrative support, and the women\u2019s team was finally brought under the same organising body as the men. The ECB made the promotion of women\u2019s cricket one of its central goals, and the budding of talent like Claire Taylor, Katherine Brunt and Isa Guha was the result.\n\n\n\nFor Smithies, however, there were frustrations, not least that the professional coaches brought in to oversee training \u2013 including Paul Farbrace and Graham Dilley \u2013 did not realise that the women\u2019s game was considerably different to the men\u2019s. \u201cWe\u2019d been aching for [a change] but I struggled with it because they had different ideas from what I was used to. It would wind me up when they made fielding changes that made no sense, because women don\u2019t hit the ball as hard as men. The angles of the ball off the bat were different, too, because the bowling was slower. They didn\u2019t grasp that early on.\u201d\n\nThe Edwards era and beyond\u00ad\u00ad Facebook Twitter Pinterest Charlotte Edwards bats against Australia.

Five years later Connor led England to their first Ashes win in 42 years \u2013 the same year Vaughan, Flintoff, Pietersen and co landed their own historic victory against Australia.

Photograph: Darren England/Getty Images\n\nIt was a confidence that built over the next decade, thanks in large part to the unmatched talent of Charlotte Edwards, who made her England debut aged 16 under the captaincy of Smithies. \u201cLottie was always going to be a star,\u201d says Smithies. \u201cShe had a good eye, and because she played with boys and men while she was growing up she had that belief in herself.\u201d\n\n\n\nEdwards also had the help of a prodigiously talented wicketkeeper, Claire Taylor, whose loves of hockey, chess and mathematics had given her a fierce tactical ability combined with preternatural spatial awareness. With Edwards at the helm and Taylor behind the stumps, England won everything there was to win: 2009 was their annus mirabilis when they retained the Ashes and won the World Cup and World Twenty20 tournament. Taylor, who in 2006 beat the highest one day international score at Lord\u2019s \u2013 a record previously held by legendary West Indies batsman Viv Richards \u2013 also hit the winning runs in the 2009 World Cup. She was the first woman to be one of Wisden\u2019s Cricketers of the Year.\n\nEngland players now have full-time contracts, and with that opportunity comes added scrutiny \u2013 something the players have insisted they relish. The sudden sacking of Edwards last year, after two decades of service, was a demonstration of how ruthlessly professional the women\u2019s game has become. But this summer there will be an even greater motivation for England\u2019s players to win the World Cup \u2013 a newly announced prize fund of $2m. It\u2019s a tenfold increase from 2013\u2019s tournament \u2013 and a quantum leap \u00ad\u00adfrom the 18th century, when women played for lace gloves and barrels of beer.\n\nNatWest has supported cricket, the game for all, since 1981.

Is it time to take a step back, and what measures can you take to manage your use?\n\nThe digital age has made life easier in many ways, but being constantly wired to our tech devices can sometimes cause us to feel overwhelmed and at the mercy of information delivery systems, rather than in control of them. As Julia Hobsbawm writes in her book Fully Connected: Surviving and Thriving in an Age of Overload: \u201cYou graze constantly online, on your phone, tablet, on news feeds, Twitter feeds, internal feeds and interminable emails \u2026 Choice becomes a stalker, making you overactive, when, really, some passivity every now and then might be welcome.\u201d\n\nHobsbawm, the world\u2019s first professor of networking, having been made honorary visiting professor by London\u2019s Cass Business School, believes that we need to do more offline in this new \u201cage of overload\u201d.\n\n\n\nSometimes you may think you want to go back in time, back to when your access was more tempered, your connections fewer. The response to the rereleased Nokia 3310 in March, selling out within a week of its launch, is an example of that sort of thinking. But when it came down to it, going retro reintroduced some design flaws few of us would look back on with any nostalgia.\n\nWe\u2019re all used to texting at length, but these cool-coloured Nokia handsets have T9 keyboards, which were deemed frustrating by the reviewer for Wired magazine: \u201cYou have to rewire your brain to \u2018ultimate brevity\u2019 mode, recalling all the abbreviations, quirks and shortcuts one used years ago, not because you had limited character counts, but because it wasn\u2019t any fun to type much more than monosyllabic replies.\u201d\n\nBut the idea to introduce a simpler handset back into the market was a good one. Do we actually need everything that we\u2019re served up on the very latest device? Shouldn\u2019t the drive for simplicity also mean a more natural striving for less clutter rather than more?\n\nAnastasia Dedyukhina founded Consciously Digital two years ago with the aim of helping clients remain productive in the age of digital distraction. \u201c I used to be connected 24/7,\u201d says Dedyukhina. \u201cIn my last corporate position, serving as a client director for an internet company, I slept with my phone in my hand even if I switched it off at night. At one point, I started feeling the phone vibrating in my pocket while having no pockets. This was when I realised I needed to change my lifestyle if I wanted to remain sane.\u201d\n\nMandi Simons, a cognitive behavioural therapist in north London, wrote on the welldoing.org site about the psychological elements that come into play when we use our phones, noting the pleasurable dopamine hit we get from finding a \u201cgood news\u201d message or hundreds of likes on our Instagram feed, and the irritation we feel when the opposite is true. Simons also pointed to the rise of digital detox-style holiday retreats as evidence that many of us are looking for a break, ideally in a space where it is possible to \u201cdisconnect\u201d from tech and \u201creconnect with those you love\u201d.\n\nBut in ordinary life, when you use your phone for everything from checking work emails to paying for a coffee, going fully offline is not realistic. So how to find simplicity without losing access to all the things we believe we can\u2019t do without?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Uninstall the apps you no longer use \u2013 and turn off notifications for those you keep. Photograph: imageBROKER / Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nSeven ways to streamline your tech life\n\nEndless apps, constant updates, relentless emails \u2013 here\u2019s how to free up and switch off ...\n\n1 Unsubscribe from emails you never read\n\nAn overstuffed inbox can raise your blood pressure just as effectively as a bursting in-tray, but it\u2019s not the same thing. Many of the emails we receive every day are spammy, badly targeted, or relating to a one-off birthday present you purchased in 2010. They\u2019re not worth wasting space on. Make a pact with yourself to unsubscribe from every superfluous email for a week. It will soon become a habit.\n\n2 Get a smarter smartphone\n\nMaybe it\u2019s time to get a handset better suited to chilling out every once in a while. The new OnePlus 5 is tailor-made for a stress-free life. Take, for example, its \u201cDash Charge\u201d feature: a quick half-hour charge is all you need to keep the 3,300 mAh battery powered for the day, because there\u2019s nothing more stressful than running out of phone battery.\n\n3 Uninstall unnecessary apps\n\nWe all have apps we don\u2019t use. Whether they came with your phone or you don\u2019t use them anymore, take a second \u2013 it really is only a second \u2013 and uninstall them. Not only will it free up space, it\u2019ll be one less thing you have to update. The OnePlus 5 learns which apps you use the most and gets them ready to go as soon as you turn on your phone. Additionally, it de-prioritises apps you rarely use, which keeps them from harming performance or draining your battery.\n\n4 Turn off notifications\n\nYou really don\u2019t need your phone to buzz every time you get an email. You also don\u2019t need little boxes popping up every time someone likes your photo, or you get a WhatsApp message, or there\u2019s a news story you may like. There\u2019s always something.\n\nPush notifications, as they\u2019re called, are designed to encourage you to open the app by making you think there\u2019s something urgent needing your attention. There isn\u2019t. You can read your aunty\u2019s Facebook update later.\n\nGo into your phone\u2019s app settings and turn off notifications. If you see an option to turn off the \u201cicon badge\u201d \u2013 those little numbers that sit on top of the logo on your homescreen \u2013 then turn that off too.\n\nThe do not disturb function on the OnePlus 5 goes one step further, allowing you to play your favourite games without being bothered by unnecessary notifications or by accidentally pressing the hardware keys. Set it to automatically activate on specific apps or manually control through the notification menu. You\u2019re now in control of when you open an app, not your phone.\n\n5 Do a fresh install\n\nWhether it\u2019s a phone or a PC, refreshing and resetting your tech can make a real difference to how it runs. Make sure everything\u2019s backed up, then reset (Settings>Backup & reset on an Android phone, for instance). When the process has finished, install just the apps or programs you actually need and use. It\u2019s like having a brand new device again.\n\n6 Do adjust your screen\n\nReading for long periods on your smartphone can strain your eyes. The OnePlus 5 offers a reading mode, which uses gray-scale mapping to filter out blue light and adjust the sharpness and brightness of the display using the information from an ambient sensor, to provide a reading experience similar to an e-reader. The reading mode function can be toggled on and off manually, or can be set to activate on preferred apps.\n\n7 Go offline\n\nTurn off all your tech and have an hour once a week \u2013 or every day, if you can \u2013 purely in the offline world. It\u2019s amazingly restorative."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 15:19:04 GMT", "title": "'Road rage' motorcyclist kicks car causing dramatic pile-up \u2013 video", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jun/23/road-rage-motorcyclist-kicks-car-pile-up-video", "text": "Police in California are asking for witnesses to come forward after a motorcyclist kicked a car while traveling at a high speed along a freeway in Santa Clarita.

I only take cash.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t got much money on me and I ended up paying much of it in quarters and bar-soiled dollar bills.\n\nAmanda: Quarters? So you didn\u2019t come to a doctor\u2019s appointment with cash? How did you think you would pay for it?\n\nAdam: Work told me I had insurance! I thought I was completely covered. In fact, I\u2019d drawn up a list of ailments I planned to get fixed in America.\n\nAmanda: What would\u2019ve happened if you were in the UK?\n\nAdam: A firm handshake, and I\u2019d have been on my way. I\u2019d have been referred to a specialist through my doctor, gone to the appointment, used some of their Kleenex, then left. I wouldn\u2019t have had to pay a thing.\n\nAmanda: That is weird to me! So, that\u2019s routine appointments. Have you ever had a medical emergency in the US?\n\nAdam: Yes. I broke my collarbone pretty badly about three years ago and it was terrible. It was nearly coming out of the skin. It made for a good Instagram but it was very sore. Anyway, yeah, that was made 10 times worse by the saga that followed\u2026\n\nAmanda: I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t swiftly patched up.\n\nAdam: No! After the accident, a very kind woman at the local clinic, who I think was actually a volunteer, cut me out of my clothes, and they did an x-ray that showed my collarbone was very much broken. But there was no orthopedic surgeon there who could actually do anything about it, so they told me to go home (this was in Pennsylvania; I live in New York \u2013 a three-hour journey from where I\u2019d busted myself up) and call up some specialists once I was there. I was horrified! And in a lot of pain. And immobile. My friend had to take my pants off for me. And you don\u2019t want to know about the bathroom.\n\nAmanda: No, no, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll stop you there. So you went home, saw a doctor?\n\nAdam: I got home, but obviously I didn\u2019t have a regular doctor who deals with broken bones. So I sat at my table and went through about 10 people on ZocDoc \u2013 a Yelp-like app which shows doctors and specialists in your area. Collarbone pointing up out of my skin like a tentpole the whole time. I think the first six couldn\u2019t do that day or the next. Another one seemed weird \u2013 he looked a bit like Trump\u2019s doctor. I finally got one who would see me that afternoon, so I got a cab up and shuffled in to see him.\n\nBut then I got confused again.\n\nAmanda: How long after getting injured is this? And why were you confused?\n\nAdam: At this point it was two or three days. I\u2019d broken it on a Saturday morning and no one was around at the weekend.\n\nThis guy did another x-ray, prodded and poked me, and then listed several options on how he could treat me. \u201cWell, we could just leave it,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you could have surgery. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\n\nI was nearly in tears. I said to him: \u201cYeah, but I\u2019m not a doctor. Tell me what I should do!\u201d He just repeated the options. I hated him.\n\nAmanda: That sounds awful. But it doesn\u2019t surprise me at all. He\u2019s worried about a malpractice lawsuit, and he doesn\u2019t know your financial situation. One of those options was going to cost more, and you might not have been able to afford it. Every time I go to the doctor, I\u2019m prepared to say: \u2018Well, how much will this thing to make me feel better cost?\u2019 So what did you end up doing?\n\nAdam: I got a cab back to my house, and had to get back on the phone. I remember speaking to one doctor\u2019s office who said I could come in in 10 days. Ten days!\n\nI\u2019d been covering the 2012 presidential election and was familiar with the Republican talking point about how people should be able to choose their own doctor, etc, etc. I was thinking: screw that \u2013 I just need a doctor to tell me exactly what I should do! The last thing I wanted to be doing was sitting in agony trying to select someone, then having to decide how I was going to be treated. And at the same time worrying if the doctor was in my network (many doctors will only accept certain types of insurance. If they don\u2019t accept your insurance type, they\u2019ll still treat you but it will cost a lot more) and how much everything was going to cost.\n\n\n\nIn the UK I\u2019d have gone to casualty (ER), sat there for a bit, then someone would have seen me, said: \u201cI\u2019m going to do this to you,\u201d then packed me off home. And obviously it would have been free.\n\nAnyway, I eventually got an appointment for the next day with another doctor. Thank God this guy basically told me my injury was a mess, and that I needed surgery.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe how relieved I was.\n\nAmanda: But I understand why the doctor gave you those choices. A natural follow-up comment in the doctor\u2019s room is: well, how much does that cost?\n\nAdam: Well, since then, people have told me about the fear of malpractice suits. But they\u2019re medical professionals! What about the Hippocratic oath? Aren\u2019t they obliged to give me the most appropriate treatment? And I am now more aware that I can ask about the cost. At the time, I assumed that was something that was all on me to deal with my insurance company.\n\nAmanda: Do you feel like there is a difference in the quality of care you\u2019ve received here v what you get in the UK?\n\nNot really. I went to the dentist the other day and they gave me a little bag with some freebies in it. But then they charged me $1,000, so I didn\u2019t feel it quite offset the difference (that said, you do have to pay for some dental work in the UK.)\n\nThe thing that struck me since the collarbone incident is that I feel much more likely to put off going to the doctor here than at home. I feel like I have to research the cost before I go, which often seems daunting. And I\u2019m lucky \u2013 I have healthcare. People who don\u2019t have coverage must be not going to the doctor all the time. And presumably for some serious stuff.\n\nAmanda: One thing I\u2019ve learned from you and the other British people I know is that avoiding healthcare because of the cost is a very strange thing to be happening in a wealthy country. I can\u2019t remember a time when I didn\u2019t think: \u2018Oh, you should only go to the doctor when you\u2019re very ill, or it won\u2019t be fixed by ibuprofen or cough medicine.\u2019\n\nAdam: Yeah, that was completely alien to me. I had a sore back the other day, and after some extensive research on Yahoo Answers I learned it could be a serious kidney problem.\n\nMy first thought was: well, if it is, I\u2019m going straight back home. (It wasn\u2019t a kidney problem. I\u2019d hurt it cutting some grass.)\n\nObama attacks Republican health bill as 'massive transfer of wealth' to the rich Read more\n\nBut god forbid I got a serious illness. I would be on the first plane back.\n\nAmanda: That would be a good place to end it \u2013 but I do have one more question! Do you have any sense, as a person who has an employer-based healthcare plan in the US, what the Senate plan could do to your healthcare?\n\nAdam: To be honest, no. I\u2019ve focused on the bits everyone seems to be talking about \u2013 the people who would lose their healthcare, the potential for people with pre-existing conditions having to pay more. As someone who is lucky enough to have a job I guess I\u2019m going to be OK. But that\u2019s the whole point, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s the less fortunate who are going to suffer."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 10:00:05 GMT", "title": "On Denmark's Jutland coast an elegant new museum counters a Nazi monolith", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/24/tirpitz-museum-west-jutland-denmark-hitler-atlantic-wall", "text": "The Tirpitz bunker has been a squat, dark presence on the dunes of West Jutland\u2019s Bl\u00e5vand since 1944.

In the distance there are sand dunes knotted with sea lyme and marram grass. It is a peaceful scene \u2013 but then you come across Tirpitz: a menacing fortification that was part of Hitler\u2019s Atlantic Wall defences, which extended from Nordkapp, Norway, all the way to the Pyrenees.\n\nThe immense Tirpitz concrete block, near Bl\u00e5vand, was constructed in late 1944 to protect the sea route to Esbjerg harbour. The war\u2019s end meant that it was never fully completed, yet it remains a vivid reminder of a darker past. Next week, a contemporary exhibition complex will open, revealing the little-known stories of this remote corner of Denmark.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An artist\u2019s impression shows how the Atlantic Wall fortification is incorporated into the new building.\n\nThe elegant new museum, joined to the bunker by a tunnel, was designed by architects Bjarke Ingels. It is the antithesis of its hefty, imposing neighbour. A series of incisions appear in the sand dunes, leading to a hidden, airy square from which the exhibition spaces radiate.\n\n\u201cWe had two demands of the architects,\u201d says Claus Kjeld Jensen, director of Varde Museums: \u201cWe wanted world-class design; but also the museum had to have coherence with its natural surroundings. It is important that this space should embrace the light.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A rendering showing how the museum blends with its surroundings.\n\nInside, the three new permanent exhibition spaces have been conceptualised by Dutch designers Tinker Imagineers.

The figure at the top of his screen showed he\u2019d suffered a loss of \u00a317,000 in one single, brutal hit.\n\n\u201cInstantly, I saw I was dead in the water,\u201d says Chris. \u201cIt was my single biggest loss. I couldn\u2019t admit defeat, so desperately I tried to trade my way out of it until Claudia started calling my name and asking what I was doing.\u201d\n\nWhat is financial spread betting and why do most people lose at it? Read more\n\nFor three years, Chris hid a gambling habit from Claudia that eventually led to the loss of \u00a3130,000.\n\nThe opening of his new book, Win. Lose. Repeat, starts starkly: \u201cTo my wife and family, I apologise.\u201d\n\nIt is not only a morality tale about how spread-betting companies glamorise and draw punters in to a form of gambling that Chris says is no more sophisticated than a game of Play Your Cards Right. It also illustrates how all forms of online gambling have become so effortless that it\u2019s possible to place huge bets on your phone while sitting next to a partner who has no idea you are risking financial ruin for your family.\n\nChris describes a life of subterfuge: coming to bed late on the pretext of emptying the dishwasher; getting up early so that he could lock himself in the bathroom in order to bet.\n\nLooking back on when he started, Chris, 47, sees that he was an obvious target for spread-betting firms who lure customers with ads on Champions\u2019 League clubs footballers\u2019 shirts and glossy brochures promoting the activity as an exciting way to invest. In fact, he was a dream customer \u2013 a single man with his own home and no dependents.\n\nHe also had a healthy bank account containing thousands of pounds doing very little. The deciding factor, however, was how he felt about his life.\n\nBy 37, he had become disenchanted with his job as a teacher at a school in Hampshire \u2013 and was having a form of midlife crisis, desperate to feel more special and successful than he was.\n\n\u201cI was getting to an age when I realised time was running out to be the success I thought I deserved to be,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was going to be my short-cut. Gambling gave me hope.\u201d\n\nSpread-betters don\u2019t buy anything or influence markets. They are on the periphery, laying bets on how much prices will rise or fall \u2013 a guessing game which Chris says demands no more skill than playing a fruit machine.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, this wasn\u2019t gambling. When you spread bet you can have all the graphs, digits and news in front of you. You imagine you\u2019re a City trader, sitting in front of eight screens, shouting \u2018Sell!\u2019 You think you\u2019re a master of the universe, when in fact you\u2019re master of nothing.\u201d\n\nThe drama and suspense it brought to Chris\u2019s life meant that it quickly became a 24-hour preoccupation.\n\n\u201cI needed to see those numbers constantly. It gave me a false feeling of control. I\u2019d have the screen open during lessons, as I drove. I\u2019d even have a screen propped up on the loo while I was in the shower \u2013 and more than once I got out halfway through to make a trade. I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I wasn\u2019t going to until I\u2019d made it big.\u201d\n\nAt first, Chris started with small bets \u2013 \u00a32 a point. \u201cSo if the stock market moves five points and you\u2019re facing in the right direction you\u2019d get a tenner.\u201d\n\nBut as the months went on, Chris became increasingly confident: \u201cI have an economics degree and I thought I knew better, which is the fatal flaw for every gambler.\u201d\n\nIn the first few months, he won \u00a313,000 on a single trade \u2013 almost half his annual salary. Within a year his savings account had suffered a hit of \u00a360,000. But he wasn\u2019t deterred.\n\nEven meeting Claudia, the woman who would become his wife, did not lessen Chris\u2019s need to gamble. \u201cIt just changed my justification for doing it. I told myself I was doing it for us.\u201d\n\nWhen they moved in together, the system was already set up so that Claudia never had reason to be suspicious.\n\nTrading firms never tire of hunt for punters Read more\n\n\u201cWe kept separate bank accounts, separate computers and phones. All my trading statements were online. It\u2019s incredibly easy to hide.\u201d\n\nChris found that the toilet became his refuge when he needed to concentrate in private. \u201cIt was no different from an alcoholic hiding his gin in the cistern or a coke addict doing a line off the loo seat. [What] makes gambling different is that it\u2019s got no physical symptoms, apart from bad moods.\u201d\n\nYet five years into his habit, it was becoming clear to Chris that the emotional toll was becoming greater than any financial loss. \u201cI realised it was masochism. I could never relax.\u201d\n\nHis fears that gambling would never make him the winner he wanted to be were also brought into even sharper focus by the fact that, around this time, Claudia told him she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cBy then, I was having too many apocalyptic days. Any more losses and I knew my child\u2019s future would be in jeopardy. If I stopped then, I knew I could absorb my losses. Any more and I\u2019d have a lot of explaining to do.\u201d\n\nUltimately, I could just log off. I felt cheated. I had to give up what I believed was my last chance for change\n\nOn 29 November 2012, Chris decided he\u2019d had enough. After losing another \u00a35,000 on market betting overnight, the next morning he closed the deal, refunded the remaining deficit to the trading platform, shut the account and went to work.\n\n\u201cUltimately, I realised I could just log off. I didn\u2019t feel relieved, though, only cheated. I had to give up what I believed was my last chance for change.\u201d\n\nBut gradually, over the months that followed, he started feeling lighter, as if a weight had been lifted from his body \u2013 and he transferred all the focus he had put into gambling into being a father to his son, Finn, who is now three.\n\nHe decided not to tell Claudia what he had done, preferring to process it all by writing a book looking at what buttons gambling pushes.\n\nWhen he had worked through that aftermath, Chris decided to tell Claudia what he had done. For Claudia, now 33 and a deputy headteacher, it was confirmation of what she had suspected but had never been able to put her finger on \u2013 that Chris was holding something back.\n\nShe says: \u201cJust before Christmas, when the first copies were being printed, we were sitting in the kitchen and Chris said: \u2018You know this book I\u2019ve been writing \u2013 it\u2019s about gambling. I used to be a bit of a gambler.\u2019\n\n\u201cI was shocked because I thought it was about his experiences as a teacher moving to Germany [where the couple now live]. Part of me was relieved because sometimes he had been so distracted that I\u2019d half wondered if he\u2019d a wife and child in England. Part of me felt cheated he\u2019d kept it from me for so long. But I also understood that he wanted to wait to write the book because he wanted a positive outcome to come out of this.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be the hero he had tried and failed to be when he was gambling.\u201d\n\nAccording to the UK markets watchdog, spread betting is form of gambling that has been allowed to hook in vulnerable amateurs for far too long.\n\nLast December, the Financial Conduct Authority proposed to limit how much punters such as Chris could place on certain spread-betting deals, saying that firms allowed punters to take big risks with small stakes, resulting in \u201crapid, large and unexpected losses\u201d.\n\nFor Chris, it\u2019s over, but he\u2019s worried for those still stuck in the habit, who started out wanting to feel alpha-male, but have seen their gambling turn into a guilty secret, emptying their bank accounts and destroying relationships.\n\n\u201cSome will walk away with only a flesh wound. Some will end up with something far more severe,\u201d says Chris. \u201cI have managed to limp away and recover with my relationship and some money left. But unless others find a way to log off, some never will.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Win. Lose.

It was photocopied and stapled together, and all written by me to begin with. I was a few years too young for punk, but fascinated by what followed, particularly bands from the north, where I lived: the Fall, Human League and Joy Division. The fanzine was a way to get closer to them, and articulate my feelings about this music I loved.\n\nMy friends and I used to go into Manchester at weekends. The addresses of our favourite labels were on the backs of their LPs, so we\u2019d go and find the buildings; at weekend, they were always shut, but we didn\u2019t care. We also went to TJ Davidson\u2019s, where all the great bands rehearsed. It was an industrial building with no lift; the more successful the band, the lower down they played. We\u2019d knock on the door and walk in. We saw the Fall, and Mick Hucknall with his first band, Frantic Elevators, and Joy Division (here, I\u2019m sat at the back on the right, looking straight ahead).\n\nUnknown Pleasures, their debut album, was released two months before this picture was taken, and although it hadn\u2019t been rapturously received, the buzz around them was substantial. The popular image of the band was cold and detached: they rarely gave interviews, their music was sombre, and there are few colour photos of them, because magazines printed in black-and-white back then. Manchester in the late 70s was a pretty grim place; there was an air of melancholy.\n\nIn person, though, they couldn\u2019t have been more different: they were down-to-earth, friendly and funny, and didn\u2019t seem to mind a few teenagers watching them rehearse. It only strikes me now how young they were, just 22 and 23. Even at the time, we knew what a privilege it was. We watched them regularly after this. Nine months later, on 18 May 1980, Ian Curtis took his own life. For most of us, it was our first encounter with death, though the significance of it didn\u2019t register with us at the time.\n\n\u2018We\u2019d play in the street until dark\u2019: the day I was photographed by Bruce Davidson Read more\n\nThis series of photographs, by Kevin Cummins, are the most iconic taken of Joy Division. They were about to change the course of popular music. They were wildly original, like nothing else you\u2019d ever heard. Seeing them live was a communal and transformative experience. They influenced so much of what was to come: it\u2019s hard to imagine club culture, dance music, acid house, without them and New Order. Kevin understood this: by photographing them in this old Victorian building, like something out of a Lowry painting, he showed the tension between the past, present and future. For me, it\u2019s nice to have photographic evidence of our presence. As Kevin wrote when he signed my copy of his book, Joy Division: \u201cWe were there.\u201d\n\nFor me, these encounters with them laid the foundation for everything in my life: without this exposure to culture, I almost certainly wouldn\u2019t have gone to art school or become a curator. Looking at this picture today, I feel so lucky to have grown up at that time; the barriers put up around bands today simply weren\u2019t there then.\n\n\u2022 True Faith, co-curated by Matthew Higgs, opens on 30 June at Manchester Art Gallery as part of the Manchester International Festival.\n\nAre you in a notable photograph?

A new BBC programme is putting them to the test\n\nLinda is 66, lives alone and sets her alarm for 4.30am to start work as a carer for children with special needs. She has taken on three jobs a week, despite being close to pensionable age, to earn enough to pay the \u00a3950 rent on her two-bed flat in Chadwell Heath, a workaday suburb on the fringes of east London. The bathroom hot water tap seized up long ago. Half the rings on her electric cooker aren\u2019t working. The smell from the mould and damp is overpowering. And, after paying her rent and bills, she is left with just \u00a354.12 a week.\n\nFather and son Peter and Mark are her landlords. They own \u00a37m-worth of property, making \u00a315,000 a month. \u201cIt\u2019s just the best way of becoming wealthy,\u201d says Mark, 36. \u201cSome people are saving for their first home. I\u2019ve got 40.\u201d\n\nHe admits to hiking the rent on one flat by \u00a3100 a month above the average in that part of London. \u201cAll the other agents fell in line. I was actually responsible for putting up all the rents,\u201d he boasts. Linda\u2019s last rent rise was also \u00a3100, squeezing her income even more at a time when her pay went up by just \u00a340 a month.\n\nMichael, meanwhile, is 33 and regularly works long hours as a team leader at a Tesco store in Edmondsley, a village north of Durham. His rent and bills are \u00a3800 a month, equal to around 70% of his take-home pay. A window is broken, doors rotten, and rubbish from previous tenants is strewn outside, while inside the boiler piping is exposed. Though relatively young, single and hard-working he can rarely afford a night out.\n\nHis buy-to-let landlords are young Londoners Dan and Jamie who have snapped up 14 cheap homes in the north-east. Dan lives in a penthouse flat in Leeds and wonders how he can show it off on Tinder to attract girls.\n\nOur properties are mostly in the north-east. I can\u2019t remember the last time we went to the area\n\nJamie\u2019s hobby is flying light planes. He never cooks, saying it\u2019s better to outsource dull tasks such as food preparation for \u00a310 an hour when they can make \u00a3750 an hour. \u201cThere are two types of people, winners and losers \u2013 and I am a winner,\u201d says Dan. He and Jamie rarely visit the homes they bought on the cheap. \u201cThey are mostly in the north-east. I can\u2019t remember the last time we actually went to the area,\u201d says Jamie.\n\nThis picture of broken-Britain-in-miniature is part of a BBC1 series, The Week the Landlords Moved In, that airs this coming Wednesday. The idea is that landlords are forced to spend a week in the life of one of their tenants.\n\nWe are shown an \u201cHMO\u201d (house of multiple occupation) in Milton Keynes where the rent from the rooms is around \u00a32,500 a month, but where rats run up the drainpipes. The multimillionaire landlord, Paul Preston, describes them as a \u201cfurry family\u201d and \u201csomething that happens in built-up areas\u201d. Preston is the self-styled \u201cHMO Guy\u201d who has more than 100 tenants and sells motivational \u201cproperty success\u201d seminars.\n\nMeanwhile, in Essex, landlord Prab and wife Meena run 80 properties with an income of \u201c\u00a330,000-\u00a340,000\u201d a month. He says he is \u201cdriven by providing a service\u201d and that \u201cmy tenants are my customers\u201d. He has passed day-to-day management to his 18-year-old son.\n\nIn Leeds we meet Vishal and his wife who give Prab \u00a3550 a month for a two-bed flat where the paint is peeling, mould is in the children\u2019s room, and where he has just discovered his electricity meter is supplying a second property, yet he has been paying for it. After their rent and bills they are left with \u00a387.75 a week.\n\nOnce the landlords are confronted with the condition of their properties, most say they had no idea, largely blaming the tenants for not telling them of any issues. When Linda\u2019s landlord, Peter, sees the state of his property, he says: \u201cI\u2019ve never heard from her. If there were issues I would expect her to call.\u201d\n\nAfter a night spent shivering in the cold, damp flat and going to bed in thermals, hoodie and a fleece, he says: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been cared for, and maintenance issues were not reported \u2026 I\u2019m disappointed with Linda not coming forward.\u201d He gets angry that a repair job that could have been done for a few pounds if spotted early, will now set him back \u00a3400. \u201cI\u2019m concerned for Linda, but I\u2019m concerned for us, for our business,\u201d he says.\n\nYet the tenants give a different story. Many say pleas to agents go unheeded. Others say they are simply too frightened to tell the landlord there are problems, as they fear being evicted if regarded as a nuisance. Housing charity Shelter says that in recent years as many as 200,000 tenants have been victims of \u201crevenge evictions\u201d after complaining. Landlords can use \u201csection 21\u201d notices to evict a tenant without any obligation to give a reason. However, since October 2015 private renters have been better protected.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Tenant Linda works three jobs to pay her \u00a3950 rent. Photograph: Screen grab/BBC\n\nYet tenants feel almost completely disempowered. \u201c[Landlords] have the power to say \u2018you\u2019ve nagged too much, you\u2019re gone\u2019,\u201d says one. \u201cIf I kick up too much of a fuss it\u2019s going to be easier to get a new tenant,\u201d says another.\n\nBut, contrary to initial expectations, the landlords are not monsters. Many make amends, with father-and-son duo Peter and Mark appearing to be genuinely affected by Linda\u2019s predicament, albeit at the risk of turning the show into something closer to heartwarming BBC1 makeover programme DIY SOS.\n\nWhat do the landlords learn? That they must visit their properties far more and not rely on agents. That buy-to-let is not about buying a property and then forgetting about it as the rent rolls in.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t learn is how much the landlords really make. We hear lots about the value of properties, but not about the huge amounts of mortgages almost certainly attached to them. New taxes and lending criteria also make buy-to-let less of a moneyspinner than in the past.\n\nBut the show is an antidote to the \u201crogue tenant\u201d output from some channels. Those featured are the working poor, victims of spiralling rents and low wages, paying their rent on time but unable to save to buy their own home. As Michael in Durham says about his London landlords: \u201cThey live down there buying cheaper houses up here. We don\u2019t have a chance.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The first episode of The Week the Landlords Moved In airs on Wednesday 28 June on BBC1 at 9pm\n\nFees ban and deposit cap proposed\n\n\n\nLandlords and letting agents will only be able to demand a deposit equal to one month\u2019s rent when tenants move into a new property, if the tenants\u2019 fees bill proposed in the Queen\u2019s speech this week gets the go-ahead.\n\nThe government also brought forward its much-anticipated ban on letting agency fees. Around 40% of renters pay deposits exceeding a month\u2019s rent. With average rents across the UK around \u00a3900 a month, the cap is likely to save people \u00a3450 \u2013 more in London.\n\nThe government says the draft bill will \u201cban landlords and agents from requiring tenants to make any payments as a condition of their tenancy with the exception of the rent, a capped refundable security deposit, a capped refundable holding deposit and tenant default fees; and to cap holding deposits at no more than a week\u2019s rent and security deposits one month\u2019s rent\u201d.\n\nThe moves were warmly welcomed by campaign group Generation Rent, which says it is \u201ctestament to the power of renters when we get organised\u201d.\n\nBut the National Landlords Association condemned the move as \u201ca political gesture from a government desperate to court voters who supported their opponents at the last general election\u201d."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:31:41 GMT", "title": "Ed Miliband interviews brother David as guest presenter on Radio 2", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/23/ed-miliband-interviews-brother-david-guest-presenter-radio-2", "text": "Brothers discuss refugee crisis and their own family history but not their relationship or Labour\n\nEd Miliband has conducted a reflective interview with his brother, David, at the end of a week-long stint guest-presenting the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2.\n\nIn their first joint public outing since Ed unexpectedly beat David to the Labour leadership in 2010, the brothers talked about the refugee crisis and their family history of persecution but stopped short of discussing Labour or their relationship, which has reportedly been strained for the last seven years.\n\nIn previous shows, Ed has attempted a death metal performance and had a lengthy discussion about the sound of toilets flushing, but he adopted a more serious tone as his elder brother joined him by phone from New York on Friday afternoon.\n\nDavid, who is now the president of the International Rescue Committee, criticised Donald Trump\u2019s policies on refugees and Theresa May\u2019s decision to revoke a promise made by the Cameron government to take 3,000 unaccompanied refugee children \u2013 something he described as a \u201cterrible statement\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Miliband at a refugee camp on Lesbos in 2015 as part of his role at the International Rescue Committee.

Making their way past the stalls selling beach balls, buckets and spades and inflatable flying fish in every possible hue, few glanced at a sign in the Camber Sands central car park warning: \u201cBeware of sand bars, beware of fast moving tides.\u201d\n\nMany day-trippers who arrived at the quintessentially English beach, which attracts around a million visitors a year, had no idea that this apparently calm and shallow stretch of seaside was the scene of seven tragic drowning deaths last summer. On Monday, an inquest into all seven deaths opens in Hastings.\n\nBrazilian teenager Gustavo Cruz and Mohit Dupar, a man of Asian heritage from London, died first on 24 July. Dupar lost his life trying to save Cruz.\n\nA few weeks later on 24 August, Gurushanth Srithavarajah, 27, brothers Kenugen, 18, and Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, 22, Nitharsan Ravi, 22, and Inthushan Sriskantharasa, 23, all of Tamil origin, also drowned.\n\nClockwise from top left: Kobikanthan Saththiyanathan, Nitharsan Ravi, Gurushanth Srithavarajah, Kenugen Saththiyanathan, and Inthushan Sriskantharasa.

Relatives were shocked after the council \u2013 in an incident log filed by an official on 24 July after the first two men drowned \u2013 said the fact the beach attracts \u201cpredominantly non-British visitors\u201d had become \u201can increasing issue\u201d.\n\nCamber Sands beach to get lifeguards after seven deaths last year Read more\n\nThe log states: \u201cWe are again faced with incidents of non-swimming persons of a certain culture that enter the water in great numbers with deadly results. The combination of a beach as shallow as Camber attracting predominantly non-British visitors has been an increasing issue over the last 10 years and the risks that these people create upon their lack of ability in being \u2018tempted in\u2019 to such a shallow bay are becoming unsustainable and unfair for us to deal with or carry the burden of responding to.\u201d\n\nOf the five young Tamil men, all of whom had been resident in the UK for several years, three were at university, a fourth was in full-time education and a fifth had secured a university place. They all lived in London.\n\nTheir parents accused the council of inaccurate and negative stereotyping, which they said had compounded their grief.\n\nOne family member, Githushana Gengeswaran, said the comments had caused huge upset to the families. \u201cAll the boys were good swimmers,\u201d she said. \u201cThe comments suggest that Asians in general can\u2019t swim. These accusations are wrong. Everyone\u2019s life matters whether they are black or white.\u201d\n\nThe seven deaths were not the first at Camber Sands. According to inquest records Tanzeela Ajmal, 31, a nurse from Norbury in south London, drowned on 28 July 2012. Three friends she was with also got into difficulty but were resuscitated. In July 2015, Thatchayiny Segar, 30, an accountant from Dagenham, drowned.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A new safety notice on Camber Sands in East Sussex. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA\n\nWhen each of the drownings occurred there were no lifeguards on the beach, something the bereaved relatives have repeatedly condemned.\n\nThe perilous nature of Camber Sands\u2019 waters is a longstanding issue. The Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) has been talking to Rother district council since 2003 about safety issues. In 2013, the RNLI recommended that a lifeguard service be introduced at the beach, but that was not taken up by the council. But following the deaths last summer, the council came under enormous pressure to change this policy and agreed to allocate \u00a351,000 in its 2017-18 budget to bring in seasonal lifeguard cover at Camber Sands.\n\nAccording to the RNLI, four lifeguards are now stationed at the beach until the end of the summer holidays. The lifeguards are there from 10am until 6pm, with patrols focused on areas marked by red and yellow flags \u2013 the safest areas for swimming. Lifeguards will also respond to emergencies in other parts of the beach if necessary.\n\nAt a pre-inquest review, Patrick Roche, representing the Tamil families, said that as well as the deaths there had been seven \u201cnear-deaths\u201d at Camber and that this week\u2019s inquest, which is scheduled to last five days, should look at whether Rother district council could or should have done more to protect the lives of bathers at Camber Sands. The inquest will look at the conditions on the beach \u2013 such as sand bars where those unfamiliar with the terrain can get stranded when the tide, one of the fastest-moving in the UK, comes in.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A lifeguard at Camber Sands. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian\n\nToni Cressy, 33, a regular beachgoer, welcomed the introduction of lifeguards this summer but said that it was not enough. \u201cWe go to Southend beach quite a bit and there are far more lifeguards and safety measures there.\u201d\n\nCamber Sands: family express anger over deaths of five friends from London Read more\n\nRother district council has said it will not comment before the inquest but will issue a statement when it concludes. In a statement the RNLI said it had seasonal lifeguards on 250 beaches across the UK, adding that they helped 20,538 people and saved 127 lives in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe RNLI\u2019s advice for anyone planning a trip to the beach is to respect the water, check weather and tide times before you go and, if planning to go into the water, swim at a lifeguarded beach, between the red and yellow flags,\u201d said a spokesman.\n\nThe families of the Tamil men said that 10 months on from the tragedy they had not even started coming to terms with the losses. In an interview with the Guardian, three of the mothers sat weeping, with their heads in their hands.\n\nJegaleela Saththiyanathan, 52, who lost both her sons, said: \u201cI believe that if the lifeguards had been on the beach last summer my sons could have been saved. I feel so lost and empty without them. Now I have no one to call me mum. We fled Sri Lanka because we were persecuted there and our lives were at risk. We never thought that after surviving what happened to us there that we would lose our children in a safe country like England.\u201d"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 05:30:03 GMT", "title": "Why Mum packed Dad away inside a suitcase", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/mum-dad-suitcase-letters-father-mother-love-war-rosheen-finnigan", "text": "Rosheen Finnigan learned early that asking about the father she\u2019d never known was off limits. Then, one day, her ageing mother revealed a cache of letters that plotted the course of young love cut short by war\n\nThere were things about my early childhood that I did not understand. I accepted, but did not really question. I knew the bare bones: that my father had died in the war and that, to enable her to pursue her career in the documentary film industry, my mother sent me to a boarding school when I was nearly three. And I knew that she had married my stepfather in 1947, but it wasn\u2019t until four years later, when I was 10 and she was pregnant with my half-brother, that I finally came home for good to lead a family life.\n\nMy childhood before that was a bit unorthodox and rootless, but not unhappy. The schools I went to were well chosen, caring and liberal. I remember long, golden summers on the Sussex Downs spent with friends of my mother and filled with fun and kindness. My paternal grandmother, who often looked after me, was always loving and welcoming \u2013 with buttons to sort and cakes for tea.\n\nLooking back, I think that I was rather like a kibbutz child. I looked for and took affection from whoever had it to give. My mother was always there, but in the background. She was, however, the centre of my life, around whom I travelled.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosheen Finnigan, aged 18 months, with her mother, Mary. Photograph: Courtesy Rosheen Finnigan\n\nThese were my memories. But what I still find difficult to understand is why, during the times we were together, she gave me no idea or sense of my father. She never really talked to me about him. There were no photographs of them, or of him or us in the little house in Finsbury, near Clerkenwell in London, that she had acquired to welcome him back from the war, and which, tragically, he never saw. There was one vivid memento: an old wooden gramophone, nicknamed Griselda, with a huge leather horn, which I knew had been his. But that, too, disappeared when my stepfather moved in. I came home and it was gone, the last vestige of my father.\n\nMy grandmother had photographs and told me stories about him, but they were the stories of the boy David, not the man \u2013 my mother\u2019s husband, my father. And although I was anxious and wanted to ask my mother about him, I somehow sensed that to do so would be to enter a danger zone; he had to stay a mystery to me.\n\nSo it would remain, even after I married and had my own family and my mother in late middle age had left her beloved London, where she had spent most of her life, for Ireland, the land of her birth and my stepfather\u2019s heart.\n\nThen one day, when she was old, frail and widowed and I was staying with her in Dublin, she handed me, one by one at first, and then all of them, a cache of letters I never knew existed but which she had kept with her, hidden, wherever she lived.\n\nThey were letters that she, Mary, and David had written to each other from the day after they first met in 1938, and fell in love, to the day in May 1943 when the correspondence was abruptly terminated almost in mid-sentence by his death in faraway India.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosheen Finnigan. Photograph: Picasa/Courtesy Rosheen Finnigan\n\nAnd what letters! They flowed in a continuous stream from Finsbury, Kensington, Bletchley, Skegness, Mombasa, Madagascar, New Delhi, sparkling with wit, passion, joie de vivre and despair, and a maturity and sophistication astonishing for a couple barely out of their teens. I was overwhelmed by the strength and urgency of their love, the ecstatic times they had together \u2013 time made more precious by an increasingly brutal war.\n\nMost of all, the letters at last gave me my father. The young man who burst out of them filled a hole in my heart I didn\u2019t realise was there. Clever, funny, sunny, his love and concern for me leapt off the pages. He fell for my \u201cgrumpy indignant face\u201d on first sight and later mourned the fact that he was missing seeing me grow. Tears fell on the pages as I read and mourned for what could have been. He would have been such a sweet and loving father.\n\nI discovered what a distinguished naval career he had had. How he played an important role in the first major combined operation of the war, to oust the Vichy French regime from Madagascar, for which he was mentioned in despatches, and how he went on to work for the intelligence service in India. How proud I was of him. Why didn\u2019t I know of their marriage, of their brief months living together as man and wife? Why did I never know that they married at the same Finsbury register office where my husband and I were married 22 years later? Why didn\u2019t I know that my mother was one of the first recruits to the newly created intelligence centre at Bletchley Park?\n\nThe letters filled many gaps in my understanding but could not answer the most important question that I asked myself, not as a child but as a woman with children of my own: why, when we had both lost so much \u2013 she a husband, me a father \u2013 did my mother send me away so soon and so young?\n\nIt was in another letter, written to David\u2019s sister a few months after his death, that I found her explanation:\n\n\u201cLately,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthe only message I have had for the outside world is that life stinks \u2013 a monotonous theme for letter writing. But now life [is] still stinking, there is more to say. I recognise that I cannot look after Rosheen properly and have a career as well unless I bury us both in the country and try to eke out an existence on \u00a35 a week.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosheen Finnigan\u2019s mother, Mary. Photograph: Courtesy Rosheen Finnigan\n\n\u201cI have found an excellent boarding school which has a nursery for babes of 2-4 and she can be with children like her brothers and sisters might have been. I am certain that she would be much happier there than living the peculiar sort of existence we lead now, which is half and half of everything, and both miserable. Rosheen will thank me more for making a career for myself and not claiming any return for outrageous sacrifice when she is older.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to say that she has met a man \u2013 \u201cyes another, who seems to think that working in documentary films was what I was born for. His contacts in the film industry are numerous. According to him they will welcome me with open arms\u201d \u2013 which they did!\n\nAnd that\u2019s what happened. I went to the \u201cexcellent boarding school\u201d and she went into the film biz, where she flourished and stayed until she became pregnant and \u201cnormal\u201d family life began for us in the little house in Lloyd Square.\n\nBut I think it was too late to be normal, whatever that is. My stepfather was a very honourable and decent man but rather distant and aloof. His life revolved around my mother and he was not at ease with a young adolescent girl dropped permanently in his nest after years of only flitting in and out.\n\nMy mother told me my stepfather had fearsome nightmares about the sudden reappearance of my father. I wish I\u2019d known\n\nMy mother, a formidable and talented woman, completely controlled the emotional climate of the house. When it was good it was very very good, but when it was bad it was horrid and I was often anxious and wary. But there were lots of good things, the best being my relationship with my new brother, whom I adored and who returned me unconditional love. The house was full of books and pictures, their friends were many and interesting and always nice to me at the numerous dinner parties and gatherings. There were long holidays in Ireland (my stepfather was an Irish academic and writer). But I never felt it was my home.\n\nAnd there was never any talk or reference to my father. My mother told me when she gave me the letters that my stepfather had fearsome nightmares about the sudden reappearance of my father. I wish I\u2019d known. Perhaps it helped explain the disappearance of Griselda and the hiding of the letters.\n\nAh! \u2026 the letters. Reading them gave me some insight into how truly catastrophic my father\u2019s death had been for my mother, especially following on the heels of that of her much-loved brother.\n\nI understand why she told no one of David\u2019s death for days. It was easier not to believe. I also understand why she hid the letters deep in the locked vault that was the David and Mary part of her life.\n\nBut I wish she hadn\u2019t hidden them from me. I wish that she had shown me, shared with me. I was his child, my children his grandchildren. I think that she saw David\u2019s death as her tragedy, him as her lover and forgot that he was also my father.\n\n\u2022 Letters from the Suitcase, edited by Rosheen and Cal Finnigan (Headline, \u00a318.99).

Here\u2019s why TV is really taking us all back in time\n\n\u201cHello! This must feel like deja vu. But that\u2019s television for you. Same thing. Slightly different faces.\u201d\n\n\n\nThus did Richard Ayoade open Channel 4\u2019s reboot of its cult 1990s hit The Crystal Maze. The new presenter, as brilliantly deadpan and subtly destabilising a presence as the original host Richard O\u2019Brien, gave a brief explanation of the game for newcomers: \u201cI will lead five contestants round the maze at an artificially accelerated pace in order to give the illusion of jeopardy. There will be fiendish games, fistfuls of crystals and an ungainly scramble for gold tokens in that dome.\u201d\n\nIt is a rare reboot, in that it looks and feels as good as (maybe even slightly better than) the original. But revivals themselves are becoming more and more common. Within the last couple of years there have been, among many others, new series of Blind Date, The X-Files, Twin Peaks, Prison Break, The Gilmore Girls, Arrested Development (with another set of Bluth family adventures due in 2018), and The Price Is Right and Streetmate are also in the pipeline.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The all-new Blind Date, with your host Mr Paul O\u2019Grady. Photograph: Mark Yeoman\n\nTelevision, as Ayoade noted, has never been averse to retreading old ground. But the enthusiasm for reviving old favourites has rarely been stronger than it is at the moment.\n\nPartly, this is due to demographics. Most of the originals being resurrected date from the 80s and 90s. Their viewers are now into their 30s, which is usually the point in life at which nostalgia combines with fear of the future (just working, penurious retirement and death) to set you scrambling for anything that reminds you of the comfort and safety of childhood. And thirtysomethings\u2019 disposable income brings in advertising dollars that mean commissioners are encouraged to give them anything they want.\n\nWhy the new Twin Peaks is way better than the original Read more\n\nBut there is a fresh impetus to the rebooting fervour. Streaming platforms such as Netflix and Amazon have created a new context for providing and watching shows. First of all, they are desperate for content, which makes them keen to trawl the archives and set proven hits in front of old fans and new audiences. In the modern diminished and fragmented market, these shows only have to capture a fraction of the viewing figures they did during their first outings to be deemed worthy of recommission.\n\nSecond, streaming allows people to get up to speed with old shows very quickly and overcome many of the traditional obstacles to engaging with a new series that has arrived years after its progenitor. If you\u2019re a viewer with a mere 20 or so summers under your belt, the third series of Twin Peaks or the 10th series of Mulder and Scully\u2019s investigations follow straight on from the earlier ones with very little to trouble or vex you, apart from the fact that some of the actors look appreciably younger than they did in the pilots. Time has no meaning to the binge-watcher, but it means more and more episodes can be seamlessly added to the package, which makes it more and more lucrative for everyone involved in broadcasting it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Time has no meaning to the binge-watcher \u2026 The X-Files. Photograph: Allstar\n\nAll of these factors will no doubt intensify as tech giants like Facebook (which has just placed its first ever orders for long-form original series), Apple (which recently poached two executives from Sony Pictures Television to head up its entertainment division) and Snapchat (which just ordered 10 short-form series as part of its $100m deal with Time Warner) enter the fray. More hunting for content, more fragmentation and cannibalisation of the market.\n\nDoomsayers claim all this is both a cause and a sign of creative bankruptcy. But this claim doesn\u2019t stand up to even the briefest scrutiny: the lust for reboots and sequels exists during one of the most, if not the most, incredible periods of small-screen storytelling there has ever been. Moreover, remakes \u2013 as The Crystal Maze itself proves \u2013 can be as good as, or outshine, the originals.\n\nEven if they\u2019re not (hello, Prison Break boys), a return of old favourites is an enduring comfort during testing times. As these don\u2019t look like ending any time soon, I am glad that in the modern televisual market, nor does anything else."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:43:13 GMT", "title": "'I wanted the building to fly': Renzo Piano's Santander gallery opens", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/23/renzo-piano-santander-spain-art-gallery-opens", "text": "\n\nTwo great hull-like forms stand on the seafront in Santander, northern Spain, clad in thousands of pearlescent discs, like a pair of ships encrusted with exotic barnacles.\n\nJacked up 6 metres (20ft) into the air on slender white pillars, allowing views through to the water, this is the new Centro Bot\u00edn, an \u20ac80m (\u00a370m) art gallery by Renzo Piano, which opened to the public on Friday.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Italian architect Renzo Piano visits the Centro Bot\u00edn the day before its opening.

You can grow great tomatoes outside in the UK, but it\u2019s a gamble: they like long, hot, dry summers, not short, wet ones.\n\nThere are two types of tomatoes: cordon and bush. The other name for cordon tomatoes is \u201cindeterminate\u201d, meaning they could grow on and on as long as the conditions allow, so these you have to prune. Do this by pinching out the side shoots that emerge between leaves and the main stem, and pinching out the main shoot when it has five to eight trusses \u2013 fruiting stems \u2013 of tomatoes. (Four or five trusses is best for cordon tomatoes grown in a pot.) Determinate, or bush, tomatoes can be left to do their own thing, no pruning necessary.\n\nOur wet, humid conditions are manna for blight (Phytophthora infestans), a disease that starts with brown splodges on the edges of the leaves and then rapidly runs all the way down the stems and into the fruit, turning the whole plant to mush and leaving the tomatoes inedible. Blight is spread by spores that move on the wind, so outdoor-grown tomatoes are vulnerable, particularly bush tomatoes, whose dense leaf shape limits air circulation. If they get blight, they tend to go down very quickly.\n\nOne trick to beat blight is to plant early-fruiting varieties that have some resistance to the disease. Cordon tomatoes \u2018Mountain Magic\u2019 and \u2018Primabella\u2019 are both getting a lot of good press; I\u2019ve always found the tiny fruit of \u2018Matt\u2019s Wild Cherry\u2019 reliable. Older varieties \u2018Lemon Drop\u2019 and stripy \u2018Tigerella\u2019 are said to have some blight resistance, too.\n\nHow to grow all kinds of alliums | Alys Fowler Read more\n\nWhichever variety you choose, you need to cajole your plants into growing as quickly as possible. Right now, tomato plants should be flowering, so it\u2019s time to start feeding. I use homemade comfrey fertiliser and a small handful of seaweed pellets every four to six weeks. If you see roots appearing at the surface of the pot, top-dress with mulch or compost and keep watering.\n\nProtected environments minimise the chance of blight spores reaching your plants. If you have a greenhouse, a sunny porch, a patio coldframe, polytunnel or a large enough cloche to protect your toms, use it. Spacing between plants is essential \u2013 at least 45cm apart outside if you can. Too close together and poor air circulation allows blight to run amok more quickly. If your tomatoes are in pots, put other plants (not potatoes, which also get blight) in between.\n\nIf one plant goes down, remove it immediately (never hold out in the hope that it will get better) and you may be able to save the others; or at least pick enough green fruit to make chutney. It\u2019s admittedly the booby prize for outdoor toms, but it\u2019s better than no prize at all."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 10:00:04 GMT", "title": "Toyota CH-R car review: \u2018The most over-designed vehicle I\u2019ve come across\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/24/toyota-ch-r-car-review", "text": "Really, though, why do you want a small family SUV?

We believe in reincarnation here at the Krishna Eco Farm, and I feel that I was a gardener in a previous life.\n\nI have been on the farm since 1989, having first been to a Krishna farm in Watford in 1981. Back then, I was living in a squat and hanging around the West End of London, drinking and getting into trouble. But the Krishna way of life gave me a new goal, rather than always thinking about where I could get my next fix from.\n\nI live right next to the farm in Lesmahagow. We\u2019re on a long, winding hillside. We\u2019ve converted the old farmhouse at the top of the hill into a function hall. Farther down the hill, there are two ashrams, one for the men and the other for the women. We have a walled garden and a herb garden, and some lawns for recreation. Four greenhouses sit on the side of the hill, and there\u2019s also an orchard. The hill carries on into the village, where the farm owns a handful of houses.\n\nMe and my garden: \u2018For clients I\u2019m conscious of design, but at home I cram plants in\u2019 Read more\n\nQuite often I\u2019m up at 2am, when the world is peaceful, and I listen to some meditation music to make me feel good. At about 5am, I go to the temple within the farm to do some chanting; it\u2019s how I get ready to work on the garden in a loving mood. Then, at 9am, I start to gather the volunteers who work on the farm for six hours a day in exchange for food and accommodation. In the summer, we have meals in the meditation garden and play music there.\n\nThere are usually half a dozen volunteers, and I ask them each to work on different jobs. We plant and pick flowers in the greenhouse, plant tomatoes, pick soft fruit, weed, dig up the potatoes and harvest the spinach.\n\nMy favourite flowers are the gladioli: they are very tall and come in a whole range of different colours. We use them in the temple to make opulent displays.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy favourite spot\n\n\n\n\n\nI love sitting in the greenhouse when the flowers are out, and playing them music \u2013 they actually grow towards the source of the music. I see plants as living beings with souls, so I like to create a loving atmosphere for them and the volunteers. We grow French beans and peppers in the greenhouse: it\u2019s the place where everything starts. I love spending time here, cultivating my plants."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 05:00:02 GMT", "title": "Blind date: \u2018My appetite failed to join us\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/blind-date-alan-isobel", "text": "Did Alan, 50, commercial manager, and Isobel, 42, therapist and writer, hit it off?\n\nAlan on Isobel\n\nWhat were you hoping for?\n\nThat my date wouldn\u2019t come into view, take a look at me, turn on her heel and leave.\n\nFirst impressions?\n\nRelaxed, friendly and, assured.

The link between the fruit and the season is perfect but predictable, so, rather than conjuring up yet more images of picnics and Pimm\u2019s, I want to talk about the inspiration behind today\u2019s recipe for strawberry ketchup.\n\nI came up with the idea earlier this year, when we were preparing for an afternoon tea at a pop-up in Selfridges. The pop-up, called wastED, was the brainchild of Dan Barber from Blue Hill Farm in New York, a great chef, a big thinker and a man on a mission \u2013 a revolutionary mission to completely rethink our attitude to the food we routinely waste.\n\nThat\u2019s at both ends of the spectrum, as much in terms of the cooking (and throwing away) we do at home \u2013 the carrot tops and cauliflower stems, the onion peel and potato skins \u2013 as in terms of our whole food system and the way that waste seems to be built into the way our food is produced.\n\nIn all our homes and restaurants, food that doesn\u2019t need to be thrown away is thrown away, and the statistics are mind-boggling: we chuck 18m tonnes of food a year in the UK alone, and much of it with a clean conscience. We aren\u2019t yet educated to regard a pile of potato peelings as an opportunity to create something delicious: mixed with a little harissa and olive oil, say, then baked in a hot oven for about 10 minutes, they become lovely little crisps that are just the things to toss through a salad. Likewise, we don\u2019t realise that cauliflower leaves and stalks are as wonderful to eat as the florets: blanched and roasted, for instance, or grated into a \u201crice\u201d or \u201ccouscous\u201d along with the rest of the head. Onion skins and parsley stalks are as useful in a stock as the onion wedges and bouquet garni we usually reach for; stale bread makes the best croutons, overripe bananas the best banana bread.\n\nAnd so to the punnet of strawberries that inspired my ketchup. They\u2019d been in my fridge for a good two weeks, all bruised, sad-looking, hugely overripe and not in any fit state to eat raw. I could have roasted them into a kind-of-compote for spooning on yoghurt, but instead I blitzed them into an unusual and winning ketchup. So, strawberries will feature on my garden table this summer, but now they\u2019re as likely to be in a jar next to the barbecued meat as served with cream.\n\nStrawberry and basil tart\n\nYou can make the cream a day ahead and keep in the fridge, but don\u2019t get ahead with the strawberries: they\u2019ll go too soft if left to sit around for more than three hours. Serves six.\n\nFor the pastry cream\n\n300ml whole milk\n\n60g caster sugar\n\n30g unsalted butter, cut into 2cm dice\n\nScraped seeds from \u00bd vanilla pod\n\n1\u00bd tbsp cornflour\n\n2 large egg yolks\n\nSalt\n\n10g basil leaves, finely sliced\n\nFor the macerated strawberries\n\n400g strawberries, hulled and cut lengthways into 0.5cm-thick slices\n\n3 tbsp caster sugar\n\n2 limes, skin finely shaved, then juiced to get 3 tbsp\n\n10g basil leaves\n\nSeeds scraped from \u00bd vanilla pod\n\n1 tbsp pistachios, lightly toasted and roughly chopped, to garnish\n\nFor the pastry case\n\n320g ready-rolled puff pastry sheet\n\n1 large egg, beaten\n\n1\u00bd tsp caster sugar\n\nFirst make the pastry cream. Put the milk, sugar, butter and vanilla in a medium saucepan and place on a medium heat. Gently warm until the butter has melted, making sure the milk does not come to a boil.\n\nIn a second bowl, whisk the cornflour and egg yolks until smooth.\n\nRemove the milk from the heat, then very slowly pour it over the egg yolk mix, whisking continuously until very smooth. Return the mixture to the pan, and cook on a medium heat for eight to 10 minutes, stirring continuously, until the custard bubbles and thickens. Stir in a pinch of salt, then pour the custard into a shallow, heat-proof dish. Cover with cling-film \u2013 you want the film actually to touch the surface of the custard, because this will prevent a skin forming \u2013 then refrigerate for at least an hour, until cool and set.\n\nPut all the ingredients for the macerated strawberries except the nuts in a medium bowl, stir gently to combine, then refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, but no longer than three hours.\n\nHeat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Cut out a 23cm square from a puff pastry sheet and lay this on an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper. Using the back of a knife, score a square inside the pastry to leave a 1.5cm border around the edges (by using the back of a knife, you\u2019ll make sure you don\u2019t cut all the way through the pastry). Brush the egg evenly all over the pastry, sprinkle evenly with the sugar, then bake for 20 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool.\n\nStrain the strawberries through a sieve set over a medium saucepan. Discard the basil and lime zest and transfer the strawberries to a bowl. Set the saucepan over a medium heat for a minute or two, stirring continuously, until the liquid begins to bubble and thickens to the consistency of maple syrup, then leave to cool. Stir the shredded basil into the pastry cream.\n\nGently push down the central square of pastry to create a space for the cream, then spoon in the cream, smoothing the surface as you go. Arrange the strawberries on top of it \u2013 it\u2019s up to you whether you do so neatly or haphazardly \u2013 drizzle over the cool syrup, sprinkle over the pistachios, and serve.\n\nStrawberry and harissa ketchup\n\nThis is lovely with any grilled or barbecued meat. Makes about 250g, or enough to fill a medium jar. It will keep in the fridge for about a week.\n\n500g very ripe strawberries, stems and leaves removed\n\n2\u00bd tbsp apple cider vinegar\n\n2\u00bd tbsp rose harissa (or regular harissa)\n\n2 tbsp caster sugar\n\n1 tsp finely grated lemon zest\n\nPut everything in a food processor and blitz until well combined. Pour into a large saucepan and cook on a medium heat, stirring often, for 35-40 minutes, until reduced by half and the consistency of a thick ketchup. Transfer to a sterilised jar, seal and store in the fridge.\n\nSorrel ice-cream with strawberries and meringue\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s sorrel ice-cream with strawberries and meringue.

Prop styling: Jennifer Kay\n\nIf you don\u2019t have an ice-cream machine, freeze the mixture in a shallow plastic container with a lid, stirring it two or three times over the course of eight hours, to give it a smooth texture. For ease, I\u2019ve suggested buying in meringues, but you\u2019ll have egg whites left over from the ice-cream, so make your own if you\u2019re so inclined. Serves six.\n\n200ml full-fat milk\n\n200ml double cream\n\n1 vanilla pod, split open lengthways and seeds scraped out\n\n4 egg yolks\n\n65g caster sugar\n\nSalt\n\n250g sorrel leaves, roughly chopped\n\n3 tbsp honey\n\n2 lemons; finely grate the zest of 1, then squeeze both to get 60ml juice\n\n400g strawberries, stalks removed and cut into \u00bd cm-thick slices\n\n40g shop-bought or homemade meringues\n\n10g mint leaves, shredded\n\nPut the milk, cream, vanilla seeds and scraped-out pod in a medium saucepan, and warm gently on a medium heat for about five minutes, until steaming. Turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 20 minutes.\n\nYotam Ottolenghi\u2019s chilli butter recipes Read more\n\nIn a medium bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and a pinch of salt, then pour in about two tablespoons of the milk mixture. Stir, then add the remaining milk mixture bit by bit, whisking continuously, until combined. Once all the milk has been added, quickly rinse out the saucepan, then pour the mixture back in, making sure you scrape in all the vanilla seeds.\n\nCook the custard on a medium heat for eight to nine minutes, stirring constantly, until it thickens and coats the back of a wooden spoon (keep an eye on the heat because you don\u2019t want the custard to boil, or it might split). Strain the custard into a medium-size bowl (remove the vanilla pod, rinse clean and reserve for further use). Stir in 150g sorrel, cover with cling-film, making sure the film touches the surface of the custard, to prevent a skin forming, then leave to cool.\n\nWhen the custard has cooled, add the honey, lemon zest and remaining sorrel, then blend until completely smooth. Transfer the mix to an ice-cream machine and churn for about 40 minutes (timings will depend on your machine), until frozen and creamy, then transfer to a plastic container with a lid, and freeze.\n\nAbout 20 minutes before serving, transfer the ice-cream to the fridge, to give it time to soften slightly. Toss the strawberries in the lemon juice and leave to macerate for five minutes. Using a scoop, spoon two ice-cream balls per portion into individual bowls. Break the meringue nests into small chunks and divide them between the bowls. Top with the strawberries and mint, and serve at once.\n\n\u2022 Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi and Nopi in London."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 07:00:01 GMT", "title": "Modern tribes: the frequent flyer", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/modern-tribes-the-upgrade-hunter", "text": "I\u2019d love to pay, but it\u2019s ask for an upgrade or spend the flight in agony, I\u2019m worried my groans would disturb the other passengers\n\nMorning, beautiful, how are you, yes, nice and early, just in case, well, we all like to turn left, yes, I know, wish I was a frequent flier, fact is, it\u2019s my birthday, thank you most kindly \u2013yes, I know the passport says it was five months ago, that\u2019s why I wait for summer, better weather, so this year it\u2019s New York, delayed birthday celebrations, first trip there, be great to get some beauty sleep.\n\nReally?

Research also revealed just how much the various add-ons \u2013 from child seats and satnavs to the rental firm\u2019s own excess insurance \u2013 can add up. It found that in some cases they can easily double the cost, although many can be easily avoided or reduced.\n\nSorting out car hire can be one of the most stressful parts of arranging a holiday. Even with a relatively good-value deal there is the worry that when you arrive the desk will have closed for the evening, or run out of cars or given yours to someone else etc, or you will be subjected to unpleasant hard-sell tactics. And when you get home there\u2019s the fear that money will be whipped off your credit card to pay for damage you didn\u2019t cause or for mysterious \u201ctraffic violations\u201d.\n\nBut there are steps you can take to avoid any hassle. The survey looked at the cost of hiring a compact family car, such as a VW Golf, for a week this summer (29 July-5 August) in 15 countries: Australia, Canada, Croatia, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, the Netherlands, the UK and the US. Six companies were compared: Hertz, Avis, Budget, Europcar, Enterprise and Sixt.\n\nThe research by website iCarhireinsurance, a provider of standalone car hire excess insurance, found that the average basic cost across all 15 destinations was \u00a3301. But if you are persuaded to buy the various extras the final bill is more like \u00a3626. The \u00a3301 masked wide variations. The US, represented by Florida, was cheapest at \u00a3196, followed by the Netherlands (Amsterdam) at \u00a3207. Priciest by some distance was Greece (Crete), where the basic cost was \u00a3488, followed by Portugal (Faro) at \u00a3398. However, even these averages hide big variations. For example, in Crete the cost ranged from \u00a3336 at Sixt to \u00a3684 at Europcar.\n\nHere\u2019s a guide to avoiding the pitfalls:\n\n\u2022 Get a move on\n\nSome of the cheapest deals will probably already have gone. There are lots of price comparison websites, and two that Guardian Money has previously given a plug to are Holiday Autos and Rentalcars.com. The good news is that, as of the start of this year, the main sites have had to make sure motorists are shown the true cost of hiring before they buy. This followed action by the Competition and Markets Authority, which last year wrote to around 25 businesses to tell them their pricing must be \u201ctransparent\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Only buy the basic package\n\nFirms make their profits by selling add-ons, and in particular overpriced excess insurance. The hire price usually includes insurance for a major crash or write-off, but leaves you responsible for the first portion \u2013 the excess. So staff will often try to persuade you to buy their insurance to bring the excess down to zero, but it can be super-pricey. There are lots of different types, such as \u201csuper collision damage waiver\u201d, \u201csuper theft waiver\u201d etc, and some will also try to sell you tyre and windscreen cover.\n\nInstead, buy an independent annual policy. Two of the main providers are Insurance4carhire, at \u00a339.99 a year for Europe, and iCarhireinsurance, at \u00a337.99 or \u00a32.99 a day for Europe.\n\nThe car hire firm will still charge the agreed excess, but you reclaim it when you get home. The drawback is that car hire desks will often seek to block a sizeable sum \u2013 perhaps \u00a31,000-plus \u2013 on your credit card for the duration of the rental if you don\u2019t buy their insurance. So make sure your card has enough credit.\n\n\u2022 One driver usually reduces costs\n\nThe survey found that an extra driver typically adds \u00a348 to a week\u2019s hire.\n\n\u2022 Say no to a satnav\n\nYou could end up paying \u00a372 a week, according to the survey. Download a free app such as HEREWeGo on your phone to access offline maps for more than 110 countries.\n\n\u2022 Take your own car/booster seats\n\nThe typical charge at a rental desk was \u00a351 \u2013 though Hertz in Milan and Barcelona charged \u00a3110 and \u00a382 respectively. Ryanair charges \u00a320 return to take your own if it\u2019s pre-booked online, and with easyJet they are free.\n\n\u2022 Check the car thoroughly\n\nMark every blemish or scratch on the rental agreement. Also check the spare wheel and whether the car is full of fuel (if it is supposed to be), and note down the mileage. Once you have marked all the damage on the form get the rental desk to sign it. Take a video or photos as extra proof. When you return the vehicle, ask staff to inspect it and, ideally, to sign a confirmation that there is no new damage.\n\n\u2022 Keep hold of the paperwork\n\nDo this even if the rental passed off uneventfully. In the following weeks keep an eye on your credit card to make sure promised payments are made, and that you\u2019re not hit with extra charges.\n\nThe best cards to use abroad\n\n\n\nA new report claims consumers are being \u201cfleeced\u201d to the tune of more than \u00a35bn a year by making bad currency decisions, writes Rupert Jones.\n\n\n\nThe research by currency firm FairFX says this includes \u00a3190m in ATM fees for withdrawing cash abroad, \u00a3644m in debit and credit card fees on purchases, and \u00a3380m lost as a result of people opting to pay in pounds instead of the local currency (the \u201cdynamic currency conversion\u201d trick).\n\nHowever, there are cards out there that won\u2019t charge a penny in loading fees or other bank charges when you use them overseas in shops, hotels and restaurants, or to withdraw money from cash machines.\n\nThese include the Halifax Clarity credit card. It applies MasterCard\u2019s exchange rate at the time you make the transaction. But be aware that there is no interest-free period on cash \u00adwithdrawals \u2013 you\u2019ll be charged a typical 18.9% APR from the day you take the money out.\n\n\n\nMetro Bank\u2019s debit and credit cards, meanwhile, are fee-free within Europe, and Nationwide\u2019s FlexPlus packaged account debit card offers commission-free and fee-free cash withdrawals abroad. However, it costs \u00a310 a month. The commission for purchases in a foreign currency is 2%.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t bought your holiday money yet, shop around. MoneySavingExpert\u2019s online currency site TravelMoneyMax compares rates and ranks them after fees and charges.\n\nMeanwhile, there are lots of prepaid cards with differing fees, rates and terms. Decent names include Revolut, FairFX and WeSwap. Unfortunately, Travelex is scrapping its popular Supercard, which offers fee-free spending abroad, though if you have got one you can continue to use it in foreign stores until close of play on 23 July."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 16:00:34 GMT", "title": "The weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 recipes for spatchcocked lemon chicken and peach cake", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/23/grilled-spatchcocked-lemon-chicken-recipe-peach-cake-amaretti-crumble-thomasina-miers", "text": "Spatchcocking exposes much more of the surface of a chicken to the heat source, and all but guarantees crisp, juicy results\n\nCooking on an open fire has been a major trend in restaurants around the world for a while now. Last month, I was in Tulum, Mexico, on a research trip, and visited Hartwood, where the heat from the kitchen was extraordinary, as was the depth of flavour of its food. Meanwhile, I\u2019ve heard so much from chef friends about Ekstedt in Stockholm that I am determined to visit as soon as I can.\n\nIt is, I think, our Neanderthal love of fire that draws us to this type of cooking, but it doesn\u2019t have to be rudimentary. Take today\u2019s chicken: it is a great (and easy) skill to learn how to spatchcock a bird, not least because it means you expose much more of its surface area to the flame, and so maximise its flavour; the Greek-inspired marinade is a glorious way to souse any bird. For pudding, I recommend a peach cake that\u2019s sweet, juicy and heady with the flavours of summer.\n\nSpatchcocked lemon chicken with roasted green olives, thyme and potatoes\n\nThis golden chicken and potato combo is made vibrant by its lemon and olive dressing. Serves four.\n\n1kg charlotte potatoes, large ones cut in half\n\nZest and juice of 2 lemons\n\n125ml olive oil\n\n1 tbsp red-wine vinegar\n\n\u00bd tsp dried oregano\n\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n1 medium chicken (about 1.6kg)\n\n2 garlic cloves\n\n\u00bd small bunch fresh thyme, picked\n\n150g green olives, stoned and halved\n\nHeat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Steam the potatoes for 10-15 minutes, until tender, then drain and leave uncovered to steam dry.\n\nMeanwhile, make the marinade by whisking the lemon juice and zest, half the oil, the vinegar and the oregano, then season to taste.\n\nSpatchcock the chicken by cutting out the backbone with kitchen scissors, then flatten the bird by pressing down hard on the crown with your palm (it\u2019s a very simple technique, and there are plenty of videos on YouTube to show you how; failing that, ask your butcher to spatchcock it for you). Rub the bird all over with a tablespoon of oil, and season generously. If you are cooking it outside, light the barbecue at this stage; alternatively, roast the bird alongside the potatoes.\n\nBash together the garlic, thyme and a teaspoon of salt in a mortar and, once you have a smooth-ish paste, stir in the remaining oil and a little pepper. Turn out the potatoes into a large baking tin and gently crush them with a potato masher or rolling pin, just lightly to flatten them \u2013 you don\u2019t want mashed potatoes, just lots of edges and cracks to catch the oil and turn golden. Pour over the thyme oil, toss to coat and roast for 45 minutes.\n\nCook the chicken at the same time as the spuds. If you\u2019re oven roasting it, put it in a tray below the potatoes, and baste with the lemon marinade every 10 minutes. After 25 minutes, swap the trays, so the chicken\u2019s at the top, add the olives and the rest of the marinade, whack up the heat to high and cook for 10-15 minutes, to get the skin crisp. (To check it\u2019s cooked, insert the tip of a sharp knife into the thick part of a thigh: if the juices run clear, it\u2019s done.) If barbecuing the bird, brush regularly with the marinade until cooked \u2013 about 25-30 minutes, turning it halfway \u2013 and add the olives to the potatoes in the oven half an hour into their cooking time.\n\nLet the chicken rest for five minutes and keep the potatoes warm, then carve and serve.\n\nPeach cake with amaretti crumble\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Full of the flavours of summer: Thomasina Miers\u2019 peach cake with amaretti crumble. Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd. Prop styling: Jennifer Kay\n\nI like to serve this almondy crumble on all kinds of peach dishes, but if you\u2019re short on ingredients, the cake works very well without. Serves 16.\n\n150g butter, softened, plus extra for greasing\n\n260g demerara sugar\n\n5 eggs\n\n125g Greek yoghurt\n\n375g self-raising flour\n\n1 tsp baking powder\n\n1 pinch salt\n\n2 lemons, zested\n\n75g amaretti (or digestive) biscuits\n\n7 peaches, stoned and quartered\n\nFor the crumble\n\n40g plain flour\n\n\u00bd tsp ground nutmeg\n\n30g butter, diced\n\n30g demerara sugar\n\n50g amaretti biscuits, crushed\n\n30g flaked almonds\n\nHeat the oven to 170C/335F/gas mark 3. Grease and line a 23cm loose-bottomed cake tin with baking paper.\n\nTo make the cake batter, cream the butter and sugar in a food processor (or by hand) until pale, light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then incorporate the yoghurt, before gently folding in the flour, baking powder, salt and lemon zest.\n\nPut the biscuits into a plastic bag and bash to a fine crumb, then toss the peach quarters in the crumbs, so they\u2019re well coated. Spoon half the cake batter into the prepared tin, then lay the peach quarters on top in concentric circles. Spoon over the remaining batter, smooth the top and put in the centre of the oven.\n\nWhile the cake is baking, make the crumble. Put all the ingredients in a bowl and rub with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Once the cake has been in the oven for 75 minutes, sprinkle the crumble all over the top and bake for 15 minutes more, until the cake is just firm to the touch (it\u2019s done if a metal skewer comes out clean).\n\nLeave to cool completely, then remove from the tin, cut into slices and serve with creme fraiche.\n\nThe weekend cook: Thomasina Miers\u2019 recipes for veal meatballs with courgette and spaghetti, plus lemon meringue parfait Read more\n\nAnd for the rest of the week\u2026\n\nThe lemon dressing works brilliantly on oily fish as well as chicken: try it brushed over chargrilled or barbecued mackerel or sardines. Meanwhile, the potatoes are a great dish to have up your sleeve, because they go so well with any roast. The amaretti crumble is very popular in my family: I regularly use it to top baked peaches or apples, or as a sprinkle over a fruit tart."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 06:00:00 GMT", "title": "East Sicily: what to see plus the best bars, beaches, restaurants and hotels", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/24/sicily-holiday-guide-beaches-hotels-bars-restaurants-syracusa-mount-etna", "text": "With baroque palaces, fine beaches and Mount Etna, the Ionian coast is home to most of the island\u2019s crown jewels \u2013 underpinned by glorious local food and drink\n\nLight reflecting off churches and palaces, views of craggy mountains and blue sea, smells of orange blossom, oregano and mint \u2026 Sicily is an inspiring place, particularly for northern Europeans. \u201cTo have seen Italy without having seen Sicily is not to have seen Italy at all,\u201d said German writer Goethe in 1787.\n\nIt\u2019s a big island, though, and difficult to \u201cdo\u201d in one trip.

Photograph: Alamy\n\nThriving Siracusa, inhabited since ancient times, is at its liveliest at market time (Mon-Sat 7am-1pm). Sellers on Via Trento and side streets around deal in delicious things: men at an upturned crate prepare spiky sea urchins with their bare hands, a fishmonger pares steaks off tuna, and stallholders preside over mounds of melon-sized aubergines. Street snacks include \u20ac2 cones of freshly fried whitebait, and oysters with a glass of fizz (\u20ac5). The market is on Ortigia island, Siracusa\u2019s oldest district, where sights include the ruins of the sixth-century BC temple of Apollo, medieval palaces and the cathedral (a recycled 2,500-year-old Greek temple). San Filippo in the former Jewish quarter offers free tours of its crypt and three levels of Greek-built tunnels plus a medieval mikvah, or Jewish ritual bath.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest San Nicolo Cathedral, on Noto\u2019s Corso Vittorio Emanuele. Photograph: Tibor Bognar/Getty Images\n\nThe look of much of south-east Sicily is a result of a huge earthquake in 1693. Afterwards, architects were given free rein to design palaces and churches in their own curvaceous take on baroque. Noto was rebuilt on a new site, streets aligned to catch the sunlight, which bathes buildings in an apricot glow. Corso Vittorio Emanuele feels like a vast work of art, or a film set.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ragusa Ibla, the medieval old town. Photograph: Vladislav Mikhailov/Getty Images\n\nOther baroque glories in Unesco-listed Noto valley include Ispica, rebuilt on its hilltop site; Scicli, in a narrow gorge; and Modica, known for dark, gritty chocolate. Probably the most beguiling is Ragusa, its \u201cnew\u201d (18th-century) town on one side of a gorge and old Ragusa Ibla, rebuilt on site by stubborn traditionalists, on the other. Here, wedding-cakey Duomo di San Giorgio gleams behind intricate iron railings, and down the square, Gelati Divini does suitably heavenly ice-creams, including cherry tomato and olive oil flavours, perfect for eating in the 19th-century Ibleo garden, with palm avenues and valley views.\n\nThe new town is the place to head after doing the sights: it\u2019s livelier and cheaper, a grid of sloping streets and extensive views. Piazzas San Giovanni and Matteotti are buzzing on summer evenings, with restaurants, gelaterias and cultural events, including a literature festival in June.\n\nBeaches and outdoors\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fontane Bianche beach. Photograph: Alamy\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to appeal on the coast, too. South of Siracusa, Fontane Bianche has a sandy beach, bars and restaurants, and a couple of alimentari for picnic supplies. But off the SS115 south of town is what may be Sicily\u2019s best beach: Spiaggia della Marchesa. It\u2019s wide and sandy, with clean, clear water backed by pinewoods. (Parking\u2019s up to \u20ac12 a day, though, so copy locals and turn right after the bridge over the Cassibile river to park off a dirt road five minutes\u2019 walk away.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Riserva Naturale Cavagrande. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nInland, the Cassibile has carved out Sicily\u2019s \u201cgrand canyon\u201d: the Cavagrande. Pack walking boots and water, then follow road signs from Avola and keep driving up, and up. Parking (\u20ac3) is by a bar on the lip of the canyon and the 45-minute walk to the bottom makes the clear pools, waterfalls and smooth rocks for lounging even more inviting. The gate has been officially locked for some time, but everyone ducks through a gap in the fence \u2013 very Sicilian. The walk back up is a lung stretcher.\n\nSouth again, Vendicari nature reserve (free, parking \u20ac1) is a peaceful oasis with 15km of paths among reed beds and beaches, hides for watching wading birds, and old tuna fishery buildings that look like Greek ruins. (A tuna museum is open, mornings only.) A cafe by the car park serves snacks and drinks beneath trees, and L\u00f9Bar, a little way down the path, does a sophisticated aperitivo with sundried cherry tomatoes, nuts and olives.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cafes in the main square, Marzamemi. Photograph: Alamy\n\nTrue sophisticates flock to Marzamemi, a fishing village long known for good seafood that has now been thoroughly discovered, its ancient core home to shoals of restaurants, bars, boutiques and even a \u201cconcept store\u201d. Ordinary homes in streets north of the centre house residents probably bemused by the designer shades and mankles, and there\u2019s a grocery here for normal-priced picnic supplies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The beach at Isola delle Correnti, south of Portopalo. Photograph: Alamy\n\nA perfect antidote is unpretentious Portopalo di Capo Passero, the most southerly town in Italy, with its castle, lighthouse and small beach. Bigger beaches and the most southerly point of Italy, Isola delle Correnti, are a short drive away. Here you can eat fat grilled prawns (\u20ac8) at Lo Scialai beach bar, while reflecting that you\u2019re actually further south than Tunis and parts of Algeria.\n\nWhere to eat\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Seafood pasta at Almyra, in Ognina\n\nPedestrianised Via Cavour in Ortigia is lined with restaurants. Try Kalliope (Via Consiglio Reginale) for pizza and fish \u2013 tuna with mint is a standout \u2013 or Le Comari (Piazza San Giuseppe) for exquisite vegetarian food.\n\nSouth on the coast road, the village of Ognina is said to be where Ulysses moored his 12 ships before his encounter with the Cyclops. There\u2019s not a lot to do there today except relax with drinks at Sunset Bar, then enjoy mussels and clams on a tomato base (\u20ac14), or 48-hour sourdough pizza, from \u20ac6, next door at Almyra, watching fishing boats head to sea as darkness falls.\n\nIn Portopalo, trattoria Sapori di Puglia, (Via Vittorio Emmanuele 49) does Puglian specialities, such as orecchiette with greens, and fish mains (swordfish with cherry tomatoes \u20ac13). Afterwards, grab an ice-cream or granita from tiny K2 at number 82, before strolling down to the seafront at Piazzetta dei due Mari.\n\nRestaurant Vecchia Ragusa (Via Rapisardi 87), in \u201cnew\u201d Ragusa, does delightfully chewy pastas (ravioli with broad bean pur\u00e9e, or tagliatelle with walnuts and caciocavallo cheese), plus meat dishes such as veal with mushrooms, olives, capers and tomatoes. Dinner for two with wine is about \u20ac40.\n\nWhere to stay\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Villa Lo Scoglio, south of Siracusa\n\nThere\u2019s so much to see and do around Siracusa that it\u2019s worth settling into a villa for a few days, which can be very affordable outside of August. Wish Sicily\u2019s Villa lo Scoglio near Fontane Bianche (sleeps six from \u20ac160 a night) has extensive gardens and terraces, and direct access to rocks for swimming.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Casa dei Carubbi\n\nIn Portopalo, new B&B Casa dei Carrubi has seven rooms (doubles from \u20ac50 B&B, including a family room by the swimming pool). Breakfast is basic (coffee, fruit and pastries) but it\u2019s great value and two rooms have little roof terraces with 270-degree sea views.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Eremo della Giubiliana\n\nIn shoulder season, though, it is possible to enjoy high style in Sicily for only a little more. Five-star Eremo della Giubiliana, near Modica and handy for Comiso airport, is a restored 12th-century monastery, with a pool in a walled garden and fine dining in its candlelit courtyard, yet deals on smaller doubles (former monks\u2019 cells with en suites) can be under \u20ac100 a night.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Villa Boscarino\n\nOn the edge of Ragusa, Villa Boscarino (from \u20ac90 B&B) looks equally medieval but was built in 1895 by a society doctor to escape the cholera in town. Rooms with shady terraces are in sleek, modern wings sympathetic to the creamy stone of the old house, and there\u2019s a garden with a folly and grotto. Breakfast is in the family chapel \u2013 cheese and salamis laid out where the altar once was.\n\nCATANIA AND ETNA\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mt Etna Crater, from Etna Sud. Photograph: Arghman/Getty Images\n\nCatania is hard to love at first sight: noisy, trafficky, and built of dark volcanic stone. But in time, the charms of this studenty city emerge. Its Palazzo della Cultura on Via Vittorio Emanuele II has an excellent Escher exhibition until 17 September \u2013 and it stays open until midnight on Saturdays. On the backstreets, there\u2019s a row of coffin showrooms in Via Castello Ursino, and a 200-year-old candle workshop (Gambino, 4 Via Porticello).\n\nVisiting Etna\n\n\n\nSicily\u2019s manmade wonders pale beside Europe\u2019s highest active volcano. Organised tours from Catania are pricey; it\u2019s much cheaper to visit independently. Etna Sud is the nearest gateway, served by AST bus to 2,000m Rifugio Sapienza (\u20ac7 return). An option from here is a cable car over the black-brown, lunar landscape to 2,590 metres (\u20ac30 return), then a 4WD ride (extra \u20ac40), or arduous two-hour hike, to within 100 metres of the summit. Etna has been quite active this year, so be prepared to change plans: the national park is huge and if some areas are out of bounds, others will have opened up. The landscape is extraordinary, and the views amazing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trekking among the lava flows, Etna Nord. Photograph: Liz Boulter for the Guardian\n\nThose with a car can avoid commercialised Etna Sud by heading above the town of Linguaglossa, through forests of sweet chestnut and pine, to Etna Nord, with just a handful of gift shops and cafes, and 4WD buses up to the craters (check they are running \u2013 concession wrangles each year can mean delays or interruptions). Recent activity means the highest slopes and craters can only be visited with a guide (try Lara Mansfeld,+39 368 663453, etnatrekking.com) but trekking among the lower lava flows, spotting skeletal burned trees and the protruding roof of a buried hotel, makes a low-cost, unforgettable day. Don\u2019t miss Dario Lo Scavo\u2019s shop/gallery near the Nord car park for astonishing images of recent eruptions \u2013 he also does guided photography walks.\n\nThere are more volcanic marvels near Francavilla di Sicilia where, thousands of years ago, red-hot lava met the ice-cold water of the Alcantara river, forming a series of gole (gorges) with rippled walls like organ pipes. Parts are open only to those who pay \u20ac13 to take a lift past a tacky dinosaur museum, but up the road is a \u20ac1.50 \u201cpublic\u201d entrance. Take the 200 steps down gorge walls dripping with oleanders and prickly pears to huge smooth rocks that look like Henry Moore sculptures. Bring swimwear and sturdy sandals and wade upriver for a picnic, or join Truvatura (\u20ac60pp) for an exciting two-hour canyoning excursion.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Internetteria, Catania\n\nCatania\u2019s at its most fun near the university, in Via Crociferi and narrow Via Penninello, where the Internetteria serves craft beers and affordable cocktails to Catania\u2019s tattooed, pierced and bearded residents. Find more counterculture at communist-themed Nievski (Scalinata Alessi 17) with plastic funnels and colanders for lampshades and leftist icons from Zapata to Che and Uncle Ho on the walls. It gets lively after 9pm and food is organic and mostly vegetarian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Homemade maccheroni at Trattoria Rapisardo. Photograph: Liz Boulter for the Guardian\n\nServing great-value meals to farmers in Francavilla di Sicilia since 1947, Trattoria Rapisardi (Via Roma 63) looks like a pine-clad greasy spoon \u2013 but the food belies this image. Homemade six-inch-long macaroni in tomato sauce is Italian food at its simplest and best. With a mixed antipasto, steak or massive pork chop, salad and local wine, the bill for two was under \u20ac30.\n\nWhere to stay\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Castello di San Marco\n\nHalf an hour from Catania airport, with views of port and beaches, B&B Aloisio (doubles from \u20ac70 B&B) is the converted top floor of architect Sebastiano\u2019s family home in a leafy suburb. Breakfast is particularly good, with homemade bread, fruit, cakes and jams sweetened with honey. Hotel d\u2019Orange in Francavilla has a rooftop pool, in-house pizzeria and doubles from \u20ac39 B&B. Or combine Etna with a beach stay at Castello San Marco (doubles from \u20ac126 B&B, castellosanmarco.it), built in 1689. Rooms are in bungalows in the grounds, and there\u2019s a pool, a private beach and a restaurant that does the seasonal organic thing to great effect. Tortuga Beach Club next door has weekend DJs from 10pm.\n\nTAORMINA AND THE NORTH\n\n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Greek theatre at Taormina, with the town centre and Mount Etna behind. Photograph: Frans Sellies/Getty Images\n\nWhat to see\n\n\n\nTaormina\u2019s about looking, rather than doing \u2013 views, fashionable people, pretty streets. It\u2019s pricey, but it\u2019s worth staying a night to enjoy it after the coach parties have left, and to have the Greek theatre (\u20ac10pp) almost to yourself early next day.

She\u2019s just republished it because the violence goes on\n\nOne day, in the mid-80s, Sandra Horley sat on a stool in her partner\u2019s studio and told him what she was seeing at work. She described the women who were coming to her refuges (which she ran on an overdraft), their terror, the injuries they\u2019d sustained at the hands of their partners \u2013 hit with hammers, raped, shot by air rifles. There was a woman in her shelter who just sat and rocked. Another held her son in her lap and cried because her husband had never let her cuddle him before.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t this that so astonished Horley. It wasn\u2019t this that she wanted to get across. What was most sinister was that all these women were telling her the same stories. They described identical incidents \u2013 the way their partners behaved, what they did and what they said, right down to the words they used. Always, these men started off charming. \u201cI heard that word almost every time,\u201d says Horley. \u201cThe women would say, \u2018If he was sitting in this room now, you wouldn\u2019t believe he could do this.\u2019\u201d The men were loving and charismatic \u2013 they knew how to disarm and draw women in. Then slowly \u2013 still mixed in with the charm, flitting between the two \u2013 the same patterns would creep in. Put-downs. Possessiveness. Isolation. When there was violence, these women were already worn down, cut off, trapped.\n\nHorley\u2019s partner, Julian Nieman, urged her to put it in a book \u2013 as a warning to everyone. Horley wasn\u2019t a writer, she was busy on the frontline and that book, a side project, took years to finish. (Horley married Nieman and had a daughter along the way.)\n\nThe Charm Syndrome, published in 1991, focused on six women whose abusers included a singer, a solicitor, an academic and a builder. \u201cBecause that replicates society,\u201d says Horley. \u201cIt\u2019s all walks of life.\u201d It drew out the patterns in the men\u2019s behaviour. In isolation, their acts seemed senseless and random \u2013 shocking losses of control \u2013 but this was far from the case. They were calculated to achieve one goal: total domination.\n\nOne in 10 crimes recorded by police are domestic abuse cases \u2013 ONS Read more\n\nThe response to her book was beyond what she\u2019d hoped. \u201cI was sort of shocked by the huge amount of coverage,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was described as groundbreaking.\u201d\n\nNow, 26 years later, it has been updated and reissued under the title Power and Control. There\u2019s far more awareness these days \u2013 domestic violence isn\u2019t hidden behind closed doors, it\u2019s on TV and the radio, in headlines. There\u2019s stronger legislation, too \u2013 it\u2019s hard to believe that when Horley was having that conversation with her partner, rape was still legal within marriage (it became a crime in the UK in 1991).\n\nBut in 2017, abusers have more weapons in their armoury: technology helps them track their partners, monitor communication, and terrorise from afar. And the statistics are still devastating. Domestic violence accounts for a third of reported violent crimes in England and Wales. Each week, two women are killed by partners or former partners; another three will take their own lives because of domestic abuse.\n\nIs she angry? \u201cI did get angry when I was younger,\u201d says Horley. \u201cI try not to feel it so much now, as it gets in the way \u2026 I guess if you probed a little, it\u2019s still there.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sandra Horley with her book, Power and Control. Photograph: Julian Nieman\n\nNow Horley is the CEO of Refuge, the largest single provider of emergency domestic violence services in the UK. Her office is stunning, right on the river Thames with views across Tower Bridge. The walls are lined with photographs of women and children, frontline workers, bereaved relatives, plus the great and the good \u2013 Princess Diana, Cherie Blair QC, Helena Kennedy QC. The space was provided by a generous donor.\n\nHorley has come a very long way and fought for every bit of it \u2013 and how she did this is a story in itself. She was born in Sarnia, Ontario, Canada, and her parents separated when she was 14 \u2013 her father disappearing over the border to the US, leaving her mother with four children.\n\n\u201cWe were deeply poor,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean penniless. Mum earned $47 a week in a laundry and $18 went on rent.\u201d Horley vividly recalls knocking on the door of a stranger to ask for food (the woman made her a sandwich) and when the family found themselves living in just two cockroach-infested rooms, Horley left, knocking on another door (this time, the house of a girl she\u2019d met on a school trip). The mother took her in, gave her tomato soup and put her to bed.\n\nHorley spent the next few years moving between people, sofa surfing. While at school, she worked. \u201cMy mother used to say the only way out of this was to get an education and that just stuck,\u201d she says. She won a scholarship to McGill University in Montreal, which included a term at Oxford. After graduating with distinction, she returned to the UK to study sociology at Birmingham.\n\nIt was here Horley saw an ad for a job as director of a project for homeless and abused women in Wolverhampton. \u201cI thought, \u2018That sounds interesting. I\u2019ve been homeless. Maybe I could help.\u2019 It was as simple as that. I applied on a whim and got the job. I found out later I was the only applicant!\u201d\n\nThis was the late 70s \u2013 Refuge opened the world\u2019s first refuge in Chiswick in 1971. \u201cIn those days, the phrase \u2018battered women\u2019 had barely been coined,\u201d she says. \u201cDomestic violence was a \u2018private matter\u2019 \u2013 something to do with \u2018problem families\u2019 on council estates. People didn\u2019t understand the dynamics, and I didn\u2019t, either. I arrived with an armload of feminist books and never opened them. I was the only paid member of staff, running four shelters \u2013 living and breathing it every single day.\u201d\n\nControlling or coercive domestic abuse to risk five-year prison term Read more\n\nThe greatest shock, says Horley, was the \u201csheer brutality\u201d. \u201cOne of my first cases was a woman whose husband had taken a hammer and chisel to her face. She\u2019d had 250 stitches and there wasn\u2019t a square millimetre of white skin. Just a mass of purple bruising. I fed her through a straw.\n\n\u201cAnd then the priest came. I\u2019d never allow this now, but in those days, you didn\u2019t know what best practice was. In front of me, he persuaded her to go home, saying her husband promised never to do it again. And of course he did \u2013 she was back again later.\u201d\n\nIn her five years at Wolverhampton, Horley helped 3,000 women. She doesn\u2019t recall one man being prosecuted.\n\nDuring this period, Horley met Nieman, her future husband (\u201cA gentle giant, not a sexist or possessive bone in his body\u201d). Having joined him in London, in 1983, she took a job running Chiswick Family Refuge (\u201cThere were two applicants that time!\u201d) which was later relaunched as Refuge.\n\nStarting with an \u00a38,000 overdraft and a semi-derelict refuge, Horley first asked a company to donate a tonne of steel wool to control the rats. It was delivered the next day and she has been asking for help, one way or another, ever since. Now Refuge has about 40 refuges. \u201cAnd they\u2019re all nice, cheerful environments, because that\u2019s what the women deserve.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s far greater awareness now \u2013 and the great thing is women know there\u2019s help available Sandra Horley\n\nDomestic violence has moved up the social and political agenda. On Wednesday, a bill to protect the victims of domestic abuse was proposed in the Queen\u2019s speech. The 2015 legislation concerning \u201ccoercive control\u201d was also a step forward, attempting to tackle the techniques other than violence that are used by a perpetrator to control a victim \u2013 from what she can say to how she must look, to where she can go. These were behaviours Horley had highlighted in her book 25 years earlier. She also advised writers on the Radio 4 soap The Archers, which portrayed this so powerfully through the abuser Rob Titchener. \u201cThat storyline helped reach a certain demographic,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Sun. EastEnders. The Archers. We need all of it. There\u2019s far greater awareness now \u2013 and the great thing is women know there\u2019s help available.\u201d\n\nBut the patterns remain the same, and prosecution levels are far too low. Fewer than 10% of reported incidents result in convictions, according to Horley \u2013 despite the fact that domestic violence is one of the few crimes where there\u2019s no doubt as to the identity of the perpetrator. \u201cThese aren\u2019t burglars who\u2019ve broken in wearing masks,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done is against the law and prosecuting them is the only way to send a clear message that it won\u2019t be tolerated.\u201d\n\nIn a patriarchal society like ours, says Horley, domestic violence will always be with us. \u201cWomen don\u2019t even have equal pay. Girls are still growing up with the message that the handsome prince on the white horse is the happy ending. For as long as there\u2019s an imbalance of power between the sexes, it\u2019s inevitable that that power will be abused by some men.\n\n\u201cYou could put a refuge on every street corner and it wouldn\u2019t be enough. I just hope the book will keep raising awareness and drawing attention \u2013 yet again. Because you can never do enough.\u201d\n\nDomestic violence \u2013 the warning signs\n\n\n\nCommon abusive behaviours set out in Power and Control:\n\n\u2022 Jealousy and possessiveness.\n\n\u2022 Humiliating and insulting you in front of others.\n\n\u2022 Sabotaging your relationship with friends and family.\n\n\u2022 Sudden changes of mood \u2013 charming one minute and abusive the next.\n\n\u2022 Monitoring your movements, insisting on time limits when you do things, checking your phone, social networks and spending.\n\n\u2022 Controlling what you wear and eat (so subtly, you don\u2019t see it happening).\n\n\u2022 Blaming you for the abuse (\u201cI\u2019m not like this with anyone else!\u201d \u201cYou make me like this.\u201d)\n\n\u2022 Expecting you to have sex when you don\u2019t want to, including when you\u2019re ill or asleep.\n\n\u2022 Damaging your treasured possessions.\n\n\u2022 Harming or threatening to harm family pets.\n\n\u2022 Driving recklessly to frighten you.\n\n\u2022 Threatening to kidnap or get custody of the children if you leave.\n\n\u2022 Telling you you\u2019re useless and could never cope without him.\n\n\u2022 Dominating how you feel \u2013 whether that\u2019s happy, afraid or frightened.

After travelling abroad and doing a series of seemingly random jobs, he is back in the UK and working in an engineering job, which pays minimum wage, is very physically demanding and dangerous at times.\n\nHe wants a new job, ideally in sport and education, but is struggling to even get interviews. He is looking into doing a qualification, either starting at night school or potentially doing his degree again part-time over many years.\n\nGiven his interest and tuition so far in PE and education, what sort of qualification do you think would help him get the biggest return in the shortest time, and what sort of jobs should he be applying for bearing in mind he has to cut his cloth accordingly?\n\nJeremy says\n\nI\u2019ll put this gently because I can\u2019t be certain, and anyway it\u2019s not the greatest crime in the world. But your partner abandoned his PE course in part because \u201cit wasn\u2019t right for him\u201d, yet now wants employment somewhere in the area of sport and education. I hope his time travelling and doing a series of random jobs \u2013 and maybe getting a bit older and wiser \u2013 has made him realise employment isn\u2019t an entitlement and you need to be able to offer something in return for getting paid (sorry for the lecture).\n\nHis failure to get interviews may in part be because he knows what he wants \u2013 a job \u2013 but he hasn\u2019t worked out what he offers in return. You might help him go over his CV and draft a covering letter to see if his work experience to date, random though it has been, could legitimately be deployed to show that he has particular experience or personal characteristics that could be of value to certain prospective employers. As he\u2019s already discovered, standard applications with no qualifications and little direct experience are going to prompt little other than disappointment. His hope of finding the qualification that would help him get the biggest return in the shortest time may be understandable, but there\u2019s no obvious shortcut.\n\nHe might, however, give some thought to becoming a personal trainer. He\u2019ll find all the details he needs online \u2013 and it could well provide him with a flexible occupation in his chosen field while giving him time to work out, rather more thoughtfully, what he wants to do and how to get the qualifications.\n\nReaders say\n\n\u2022 Start by getting involved in the activities of local clubs and organisations. Gain experience and pick up qualifications within those sports. Build up the practical skills and experience, get involved in the organisation and running of activities and start into some coaching qualifications. Then maybe take a look at teacher training for Further Education. Steve Griffin\n\n\u2022 Either he\u2019s passionate about sport or he isn\u2019t. And I\u2019m not getting much of a sense of passion. Perhaps this comes across in interviews? The impetus has to come from him, and it sounds like he needs more focus. Maybe more research, career coaching, volunteering with kids and seeing whether he likes it, etc, will help him focus on what lies ahead for him.

Simon Laszczak\n\nI\u2019m new to social care from a media advertising job but can\u2019t get a management role\n\nI am a 58-year-old man who has previously worked abroad as a media advertising executive. But when I came to the UK I was told that as I did not have experience here there was little hope of getting senior media advertising roles.\n\nSo I retrained as a support officer and have done diploma courses in psychology and mental health, but have found it difficult to get into management roles in this field too, and every application I have put out has been turned down.\n\nIs there something I need to do to get into more challenging roles in this sector? I feel too old to take too much pressure and stress, but can manage a team of support workers and deliver an excellent service. I am feeling under-utilised and need to get myself out of this downward spiral of thinking.\n\nJeremy says\n\nAs I\u2019m sure you understand, those in the social care sector are not being thoughtlessly obstructive in rejecting your applications. It would, I imagine, be very uncommon for someone with no previous experience in social care to be taken on in a senior management role when there must be many other candidates for every position who have worked their way up over many years.\n\nBy retraining and taking diploma courses in psychology and mental health you have demonstrated how serious your interest in this sector is. No one could doubt the integrity of your intentions. But at your age, and with an unusual (for social care) career background, you will undoubtedly be seen as an unusual applicant for a senior position. And rather than try to minimise this difference, I suggest you consider turning it to your advantage.\n\nAs is all too widely acknowledged, and for many economic and demographic reasons, the social care sector is facing unprecedented challenges. People may well believe that previous experience in media advertising could bring nothing of relevance or value to the cause \u2013 and at first glance, they\u2019re right. But it\u2019s nearly always possible for concerned outsiders to introduce new insights and ways of doing things when they join established organisations \u2013 which, understandably enough, often find it difficult to entertain unfamiliar thoughts and procedures. So in future applications try showing how your past experience, rather than being an irrelevance, could actually make you an unusually valuable addition to someone\u2019s ranks. It should certainly improve your chances of being considered for those challenging roles to which you aspire.\n\nReaders say\n\n\u2022 If someone had been in social care all their lives but retrained with a degree in advertising, I would not expect them to walk into a management position in that field. Start at the bottom and \u2013hopefully \u2013 quickly work your way up. CaptainGrey\n\n\u2022 As a recruiter I would want to understand why you have made such a big change, especially when recruiting to a role that would be responsible for providing care to potentially very vulnerable people. That\u2019s not to say you wouldn\u2019t be very good, but you may need to be a bit clearer about your motivations for changing your career. Stroppimare\n\n\u2022 My advice would be to broaden your experience: actively seek out the most challenging environments \u2013 for example, working with people with severe emotional and behavioural difficulties; and get trained in behavioural management strategies, end of life care, communication strategies for non-verbal people \u2013 anything that will turn you into the most qualified, resilient and confident support worker, until you are at the point where nothing fazes you. At this point you will undoubtedly find it easier to make the step up to management. room32\n\nDo you need advice on a work issue?

The first school was opened by parents in 1956; many others followed. But education is only part of the overarching campaign for recognition of language rights.\n\nThe Welsh Language Society, founded in 1962, aimed to save the language from the fate suffered by Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Breton and Cornish \u2013 Celtic languages that came close to extinction. Its successes were due to individuals\u2019 commitment \u2013 the Welsh writer Angharad Tomos, for example, was imprisoned several times for her activism. People campaigned to be able to testify in a court of law in their mother tongue; to have a council tax bill in it; to have Welsh place names on signs in Wales. My own village, Nefyn, bore a sign with Nevin on it until the 1970s. None of this, apparently, matters; what matters is a minority of families, unwilling even to be named, who want to educate their children in English, and can do so nearby.\n\nDid it occur to you to send a Welsh speaker to LLangennech? There are many thousands of us \u2013 in Wales, and here in London, like me and my bilingual children \u2013 longing to see our positive experience of Welsh-only teaching reflected and understood. Dymuniadau Gorau,\n\nDr Ann Elisabeth Pierce Jones\n\nLondon\n\n\u2022 The issues at Llangennech have their roots in the attempt by English governments to erase the Welsh language as a living tongue in its native Cymru, stretching further back than Henry VIII, whose antipathy towards the Welsh tongue was notorious. But the real attack came in the Victorian period, when a government commission reported that the Welsh were lazy and indolent and that most of their troubles originated in their use of the Welsh language and their adherence to chapel religion. Eradication of the Welsh language and the assimilation of the Welsh people into England was seen as the cure.\n\nMy grandmother, like many of her generation, was the last fluent Welsh speaker in the family and endured humiliation and punishment at school for daring to speak the tongue of home and wider community. As a result, my grandmother would not have her children learn or speak Welsh and they had nothing culturally to pass on to their children and her grandchildren. My generation has been deprived of our cultural inheritance by government policy, indifference and neglect of this part of our so-called United Kingdom, one of the poorest and underdeveloped areas of Europe. The Welsh experience of our \u201ccommon history\u201d is radically different from that which children are taught in English schools.\n\nRev Tony Coslett\n\nHinckley, Leicestershire\n\n\u2022 I was taught Welsh in a bilingual school in Cardiff from the age of five (How sad that English-speaking parents fear their children being taught in Welsh, 22 June). I went on to get an O-level in the subject and an abiding love of the language. My parents were not Welsh-speakers so, sadly, I never became fluent. But that experience not only taught me the importance of the language but it gave me confidence to learn other languages. It removed any psychological obstacle to \u201cforeign\u201d languages and so I speak English, French and some Italian, Spanish, German and even Polish. If we live in Wales, we can imbibe the cultural differences of this beautiful country and realise how strongly they rest on the language.\n\nIan Hunter\n\nFishguard, Pembrokeshire\n\n\u2022 As an English-speaking Welshman, can I ask Fred Francis and Ellen Huws (Letters, 21 June) if they are really suggesting that you have to speak Welsh to have access to the cultural heritage of Wales? This is surely the sort of cultural elitism that genuinely frightens English speakers in Wales. It is certainly true that Welsh improves employment opportunities in Wales, especially in the public sector. It is equally true that this requirement to speak the language excludes the majority of the population and excludes many able candidates from the English-speaking majority.\n\nBoth writers omit to mention that in English-medium state schools Welsh is a compulsory subject for all. Indeed, some would argue that this is a factor in the decline in the uptake of modern foreign languages in state schools. We all want what is best for our children. What the parents opposed to the setting up of a Welsh-medium only school want is simply choice, not to have this situation imposed upon them.\n\nBryan Lewis\n\nBridgend\n\n\u2022 In Wales, children are educated in English or Welsh and make friends and socialise exclusively with their co-lingists. Moreover, the Welsh Language Act effectively forces all public sector employers to specify \u201can ability to speak Welsh is desirable\u201d on all vacancies, giving Welsh-speakers preferential opportunities, even in workplaces where Welsh is never used. Eventually English-only speakers \u2013 who make up 85% of Wales\u2019s population \u2013 will realise that they are now second-class citizens in their own country. It should also be remembered that Wales has the worst-performing education system in the UK. The fact that all English-medium secondary schools are compelled to put their students through a five- year Welsh course is never mentioned as a contributory burden. And all the political parties in Wales support this ticking social time-bomb. Everyone in Wales speaks English. English is what unites us.\n\nName and address supplied\n\n\u2022 I was shocked to read that there are schools in Wales where the teaching is only in Welsh. The children there are being cut off from the most important language in the western world and will have a sorely limited future. The education that my grandchildren in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are receiving at their local primary school is so much better: alternate weeks are taught in English and Spanish, and they will be bilingual by the time they move on to secondary school. How I wish I had been at such a school.\n\nJonathan Bard\n\nOxford\n\n\u2022 The Irish language has also been used as a political football (peil pholaiti\u00fail) by political parties in Stormont. However, it is a language that has existed for over 2,000 years (much longer than English) and is the native language of Ireland. Like the other 26 counties, the north should have an act to protect the rights of the Irish-language community.\n\nAn Irish language act is proposed by Conradh na Gaeilge and is supported by majority of Stormont MLAs. Such an act would cost less than \u00a34m a year, which is a small fraction of the Stormont budget. And the money going towards it would improve the community, unlike the millions wasted on the renewable heat incentive. The Irish language community was guaranteed an Irish language act over 10 years ago in the St Andrews agreement of 2006. But nothing has been done. The Council of Europe and the UN have both recommended such an act to be implemented in the north.\n\nThe main reason an act hasn\u2019t come about yet is the lack of respect from Unionist politicians, in particular the DUP, which has mocked the language. Recently, the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, said: \u201cIf there was to be an Irish language act there should be a Polish language act because more people in Northern Ireland speak Polish than Irish.\u201d The act is a key issue in the Stormont talks. However, the DUP has still to agree to it. By not allowing it to pass, it is damaging potential for the Irish language to grow and move forward.

This is a very real and poignant matter for me, given the deaths of my daughter and her friend on a level crossing in December 2005. After years of lobbying about the dangers \u2013 and Network Rail\u2019s (and its predecessors\u2019) failures to act on them \u2013 change took place and a major programme began to improve safety at crossings.\n\nPoole points out that \u201cthe very phrase \u2018health and safety\u2019 has become a joke\u201d. People roll their eyes and shrug and the jokey \u201celf and safety\u201d has become part of the language. It has enabled those with power in government and the private sector to cut corners and get away with it, on the basis that extra rules will not go down well.\n\nWe need a major change in attitudes to health and safety. It must become ingrained as a serious matter. Joking about it should become as unacceptable as joking about racism, sexuality and disability.\n\nChris Bazlinton\n\nFarnham, Essex\n\n\u2022 The elephant in the room not mentioned in Steven Poole\u2019s excellent article on deregulation was the de facto deregulation facilitated by the government\u2019s savage cuts in local authority spending. Councils were inevitably going to respond to these cuts by reducing the resources available for statutory duties where cuts would be less likely to create an immediate outcry, such as regulation enforcement. It would be naive to think that a government obsessed with deregulation would not have been fully aware of this. This week\u2019s news of tower block cladding investigations provides grim evidence of the effects of this strategy, if any were needed.\n\nJim Hooker\n\nChichester, West Sussex\n\n\u2022 As long ago as 1840, when rapid expansion forced government at least to consider some degree of regulation of buildings, Thomas Cubitt gave evidence to the select committee on the health of towns. He warned that, without rules and regulations, builders would put up houses crammed into smaller and smaller spaces. \u201cI am afraid a house would become like a slave ship, with the decks too close for the people to stand upright.\u201d\n\nPolly Toynbee was right to insist on the need for regulation (They call it useless red tape, but without it people die, 20 June). And they couldn\u2019t, in 1840, even imagine 24 storeys high.\n\nEnid Gauldie\n\nInvergowrie, Perthshire\n\n\u2022 Steven Poole provides an excellent account of the right\u2019s professed hatred of regulation and red tape, but this ideological hostility only seems to apply to big business and the private sector.\n\nBy contrast, the last three decades have seen the public sector crushed under regulatory burdens and tied up in red tape, often in a bizarre attempt at making schools, hospitals, the police, social services and universities more efficient, business-like and accountable. Talk to most doctors, nurses, police officers, probation officers, social workers and university lecturers, and one of their biggest complaints will be the relentless increase in bureaucracy imposed by Conservative (and New Labour) governments since the 1980s.\n\nInstead of focusing on their core activities and providing a good professional service, many frontline public sector workers are compelled to devote much of their time and energy to countless strategies, statutory frameworks, regulations, codes of practice, quality assurance procedures, government targets, action plans, form-filling, box-ticking, monitoring exercises, and preparations for the next external inspection.\n\nA major reason for public sector workers quitting their profession, taking early retirement or suffering from stress-related illnesses is the sheer volume of bureaucracy that Conservatives (and New Labour) have imposed during the last 35 years. This bureaucracy, almost as much as underfunding, is destroying the public sector, impeding efficiency and innovation, and driving frontline staff to despair.\n\nPete Dorey\n\nBath, Somerset\n\n\u2022 Your article on red tape is correct \u2013 rules and regulations have enhanced safety and health, and stopped many an exploitative practice. However, the most dangerous \u201cred tape\u201d is wrapped around our tax laws. The incomprehensible density and technicality of the UK tax system allows the rich and well advised to dance around inside a baffling box of reliefs and avoidance measures. If we want a fair, balanced and more equal tax system, then we should rewrite tax law to make it much simpler and as transparent as possible. Industry and the wealthy will moan for a while, but they\u2019ll adapt quickly. Advisers will complain bitterly, but the tax system should not be used as an employment-generation machine. Ultimately, we would see lower tax rates and higher tax takes \u2013 surely the objective of all governments?\n\nChris Parr\n\nFribourg, Switzerland\n\n\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com\n\n\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit gu.com/letters"}, {"published": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 14:40:50 GMT", "title": "Summer festivals around the world: share your experiences", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jun/22/summer-festivals-around-the-world-share-your-experiences", "text": "Whether it\u2019s one of the big musical gatherings or a more obscure event, we\u2019d like to hear about the festivals you\u2019re attending this summer\n\nWith the queues at Glastonbury 2017 slowly but surely decreasing, it\u2019s time to celebrate yet another summer festival season across the world.

Thanks for taking part. Read more about how our weekly series works at the end of the piece.\n\nWhen launching into this subject I had no idea \u2013 despite the forward-thinking theme \u2013 just how much material was out there. An absolutely fascinating range of styles and songs were submitted; some bang on the topic of prophets and prophecies, others less so ... I promised myself at the beginning that both my A and B lists (keep an eye on the comments for the latter) would be limited to 15 songs each; and I almost stuck to it.\n\nOld Testament prophets get considerable coverage in popular music. Louis Armstrong tells the story of Moses and the Exodus in Go Down Moses, with which we begin, while Israel Vibration also mentions Moses and tells us that a Prophet has Arise[n]. I could have compiled the list solely from reggae songs, so fruitful was the genre for your nominations. Next up, Indigo Girls namecheck Jonas and Ezekial in a more modern setting.\n\n\n\nConcurrent with the Old Testament were the conflicts said to have given rise to the myths of the Trojan War, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor makes our list by recounting the story of Cassandra, cursed to see the future but never to be believed.\n\nOne prophetic book, the Revelation of St John the Divine in the New Testament, could have generated an entire list on its own. I\u2019ve picked two widely differing examples: the prog pomp of Aphrodite\u2019s Child\u2019s Four Horseman and the country-gospel of Neko Case\u2019s John Saw That Number (even if she does get her prophets mixed up \u2013 John the Baptist and the John of Revelation were not the same person). Crash Test Dummies, meanwhile, give us a modern allegory of the central figure of the New Testament in The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead.\n\nMoving forward in history we encounter arguably the most famous non-sacred prophet of them all, as Al Stewart sings us some of the prophecies of Nostradamus.\n\nAs we progress toward the modern era, Culture examine Marcus Garvey\u2019s prophecy that chaos would occur on 7 July 1977 (7/7/77) in Two Sevens Clash. Meanwhile, after the World\u2019s Fair of 1939-40 in New York gave Americans a vision of a utopian future, Aimee Mann looks back on the event with a feeling of prophecy unfulfilled in Fifty Years After the Fair.\n\n\n\nEnd of the world \u2013 as it didn't happen Read more\n\nThere have been many prophecies of the end of the world, not least the one that said it would end in 2012, based on a misrepresentation of the Mayan calendar. Decay Trees reflect on this and suggest that the best place to be when the world ends is with your loved one, listening to a mix tape, in Cassette 2012.\n\nSome artists have written songs intended to be prophetic in themselves \u2013 a good example is Bob Dylan in A Hard Rain\u2019s A-Gonna Fall. Not only is he prophesying, but he is also using the traditional imagery of prophecy: \u201cI saw a new-born baby with wild wolves all around it\u201d is a typical line \u2013 wide open to interpretation.\n\nI also said that I would accept nominations for songs that mentioned prophets in the title, even if not the lyrics, and Cat Empire\u2019s Prophets in the Sky is such a catchy piece of ska that it was on this A-list from the moment I listened to it.\n\nContributor misterbadexample points out that \u201cGilbert and Sullivan have songs about virtually everything\u201d and cites one that includes a prophet: My Name is John Wellington Wells \u2013 a fine contribution to the list.\n\nFinally, a song that tells of a prophet in such a fantastic manner that it deserves top billing. First nominator MonsieurZaccone had this to say: \u201cQueen in their full overblown silliness! If it has any special message, I\u2019m afraid it escapes me. But it is just fantastically, joyfully uplifting. It never fails to make me smile.\u201d Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you, The Prophet\u2019s Song.\n\nBonus \u201clongest track\u201d inclusion: ShivSidecar nominated Van Der Graaf Generator\u2019s A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers based on the line \u201cI prophesy disaster and then I count the cost\u201d. At 23 min 20 sec it\u2019s an impressive (or pretentious, depending on your point of view) slice of prog rock of which we\u2019re warned before listening: \u201cgood luck if you give it a try \u2013 not all of you will be coming back.\u201d\n\nNot all songs appear on the Spotify list as some are unavailable on the service.\n\n\n\nNew theme: how to join in\n\nThe new theme will be announced at 8pm (BST) on Thursday 22 June. You have until 11pm on Monday 26 June to submit nominations.\n\nHere is a reminder of some of the guidelines for readers recommend:"}, {"published": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 18:16:30 GMT", "title": "Let\u2019s inspire more young women to fall in love with engineering | Letters", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/jun/22/lets-inspire-more-young-women-to-fall-in-love-with-engineering", "text": "Tomorrow, 23 June, is International Women in Engineering Day (Inwed). And on this day the UK desperately needs more engineers \u2013 20,000 annually, according to Engineering UK figures. Equally worrying is that the UK has the lowest percentage of female engineering professionals in Europe \u2013 a mere 9%. Parents and teachers can encourage their children, especially girls, to take up and stick with Stem subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths), right through school to university. Projects and practical workshops will give young people hands-on experience, increase confidence and show that engineering can be fun. Our experience on engaging with school-age children is that they often see engineering as being confined to jobs in construction, transport or manufacturing. Let\u2019s not forget that engineering can be about developing products useful to society, as well as roles in industry, computing, healthcare, medicine and protecting the environment.\n\nSo as well as calling on the government to do more, I\u2019m calling on parents and teachers to seek out and present these role models in schools, through networking and in the home over the dinner table. Reach out to an engineering company near you and find an inspirational speaker. Or focus one lesson or homework assignment per week on female engineers. There\u2019s a list of the top 50 on the Women\u2019s Engineering Society site. Here are just six of my favourites to get you started: Ada Lovelace, creator of the first computer program; Grace Hopper, who created the first compiler for a computer language; Avni Shah, Google\u2019s head of Chrome development; Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX; Debbie Sterling, creator of the GoldieBlox toy company; Sylvia Todd, a most creative and inspirational teenager.

The whole package was working for him: the hair, the muscles \u2026 What is your type?\u201d\n\nThe lights change and the two cackle, a conspiratorial giggle that follows much of their chat over the next 24 hours. TLC making a decent comeback in 2017 is, it\u2019s fair to say, unexpected. Despite insisting that they\u2019ve been working solidly behind the scenes the whole time \u2013 touring internationally, writing film scripts, setting up a fitness blog \u2013 the group disappeared from public consciousness sometime in the early 00s.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Watch the video for Way Back.\n\nCollectively though, the three twentysomething women from Atlanta, Georgia \u2013 Tionne \u201cT-Boz\u201d Watkins, Rozonda \u201cChilli\u201d Thomas and Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopes \u2013 owned the 90s: their brand of sultry R&B, silky enough to woo the masses but glitchy enough to keep them interesting, has made them the most successful US girl group of all time. Their two biggest albums, CrazySexyCool (1994) and Fanmail (1999), sold more than 20m copies between them, with other singles and albums helping to rack up a total sales haul of around 65m worldwide.\n\nThat\u2019s a behemothic level of success that was felled first by the band\u2019s bankruptcy in 1995, then by the tragic death of Lopes, at 30, in 2002.\n\n\u201cI slept a lot,\u201d says Thomas of that year. \u201cWhen you\u2019re depressed and you sleep a lot \u2026 I did that and stayed in my room. I didn\u2019t watch TV and I certainly didn\u2019t listen to radio or go out because everywhere we\u2019d go, somebody would have something to say.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019d be smiling, too,\u201d chips in Watkins, \u201cand then be like, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 and then immediately, \u2018Can I have your autograph?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe two felt hounded by the press, the public and their label. \u201cPeople are ghouls,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cI got letters at my house two days after Lisa died, like, \u2018What are you going to do?\u2019 and, \u2018Here\u2019s my demo, take a listen.\u2019\u201d But Lopes, who died in a car accident on holiday in Honduras that April, was irreplaceable. TLC were never a vehicle for a producer or a manager\u2019s new sound \u2013 opening a revolving door for a new third member like, say, Destiny\u2019s Child or the Sugababes was not an option.\n\n\u201cThey are much clearer than anybody else on what is and isn\u2019t TLC,\u201d their label boss, LA Reid, told Rolling Stone in 1995. \u201cThey make it very clear to the writers and producers on their projects what they will and will not sing.

Photograph: Michel Linssen/Redferns\n\nTLC\u2019s distinct sound remains written about and referenced by music blogs. And it still influences modern pop (see 2017\u2019s biggest-selling single in the UK, Ed Sheeran\u2019s Shape of You). The group defined themselves by their three distinct personalities: \u201ccrazy\u201d, \u201csexy\u201d, \u201ccool\u201d. Seven months after Lopes died, their fourth and least successful album, 3D, was released. \u201cWe were upset, that was the label,\u201d says Watkins, of the album coming out. \u201cI guess their mourning stage for us was a week, we weren\u2019t thinking straight or in a right frame of mind to be making decisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat first couple of years you think you were all right or at least better, and then you have a dream or something and you\u2019re messed up all over again,\u201d adds Thomas. \u201cIt just really took time to heal.\u201d\n\nFifteen years on and in their late 40s, the pair didn\u2019t think that they would be playing their first ever London gig. May\u2019s solitary date at Koko in Camden Town sold out in a day, to an army of fans singing and sweating on its sticky floorboards. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had bad performances where we\u2019ve been booed, but that was hard to believe,\u201d says Watkins, when we meet the next evening in a salmon pink hotel suite. \u201cTo come here and have people chanting \u2018TLC\u2019. It makes the adrenaline flow. \u201cWe\u2019re always nervous before we go on stage,\u201d says Thomas, \u201cbut I was exceptionally nervous this time. It didn\u2019t settle till I started doing it.\u201d\n\nThat the show was a triumph just follows TLC\u2019s made-for-TV-movie trajectory. Backing dancers in gold lame costumes, a gospel choir, and hit after hit \u2013 opening with Diggin\u2019 On You and ending with No Scrubs \u2013 elevated it beyond the rush of pop nostalgia. That said, new single Way Back, which features a Snoop Dogg verse where Lopes might have been, is pure 90s street soul throwback, but the pair claim that they\u2019re not paying attention to current trends, because, says Watkins, \u201cour music will always be relevant\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hit girls ... TLC in Hollywood, 1999.

It\u2019s signature.\u201d It\u2019s true: alongside The Rachel, Watkins\u2019s was the most popular haircut for gobby schoolgirls in the 90s. A lot of faux-bickering and tutting between the two follows as they debate the flaws of contemporary artists who, according to TLC, have no sense of performance, showmanship or style.\n\n\u201cCelebrity changed, but what sticks out to me is the change in media,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIf Twitter was around when we were were out, Lisa would have the most followers for sure.\u201d And probably been in the most trouble, too? \u201cOh my God, she would have been closed down multiple times.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame with Instagram,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cIf Instagram was taken away tomorrow there would be a lot of people jobless right now cos there\u2019s a lot of \u2018public figures\u2019 now made up of Instagram models.\u201d She is unimpressed by influencers monetising their lifestyles online, but tries to hold back. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna knock your hustle. Hustle on, girl. This is the time that hos are winning.\u201d An affirmative block-caps \u201cYEAH!\u201d comes from Thomas. \u201cBut if you gonna be a ho, at least be a good ho and get paid,\u201d Watkins continues. \u201cHo-ism is working for people. Worst thing is to be a ho, spread your stuff far and wide and get nothing from it.\u201d\n\nTLC review \u2013 a forcefield of midlife R&B wisdom and physical energy Read more\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest No scrubs please, we\u2019re TLC ...

Photograph: Linda Nylind/The Guide\n\nWatkins won\u2019t be drawn on who she might be alluding to, but it\u2019s still a surprise to hear her or Thomas claim a moral high ground over other women. TLC championed female sexuality in their songs and styling, and were early advocates of safe-sex campaigns (Lopes would even wear a condom on the left eye of her glasses). Yet, says Watkins, she was offered $50,000 to visit a male fan and his wife at home \u2013 \u201cSo they could just stare at me fully clothed for five minutes, nothing else\u201d \u2013 and she refused.\n\nChilli is appalled. \u201cFifty thousand! To bring warmth and happiness into that relationship, what\u2019s wrong with that?!\u201d \u201cMy husband at that time didn\u2019t want me going,\u201d admits Watkins. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to know!\u201d yelps Thomas.\n\nBoth are single right now. Thomas has a son with TLC\u2019s ex-producer Dallas Austin, and Watkins is divorced with a son and teenage daughter. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to meet anyone right now,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cI do not want a man. If God slaps me in the face with a good one, fine, but right now, I don\u2019t want to listen to your day, I don\u2019t want to care about your problems. I wouldn\u2019t be a good girlfriend right now; I don\u2019t want to have sex with nobody.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you poor girl! You poor poor girl,\u201d says Thomas, cooing at Watkins\u2019s vagina.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be all right\u201d, says Watkins, side-eyeing Thomas with a cat-like grin.\n\nThe pair live in different cities now; Watkins is in Los Angeles, having just moved out of the suburb the Kardashians live in, and Thomas has stayed in Atlanta, but they still finish each other\u2019s sentences and slip into shorthand. \u201cYou start off with so many friends,\u201d explains Watkins, \u201cbut as you get older, you only need one or two. I\u2019m not open to just letting people into my life, I need an asset not a liability.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Class act ...

Photograph: Kevin Kane/WireImage\n\nTo their credit, the two have been categorically burned by the industry. To go bankrupt at the peak of their fame and success still stings. \u201cI will never forget the day we were millionaires for literally five minutes,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cBecause the cheque was written to us and we had to sign it over, back to [Pebbles, their former manager]. But we won\u2019t get into that since we\u2019re still in a lawsuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I could go back, I would definitely change a couple of things business-wise,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cI have learned the hard way: sign your own cheques, make sure your taxes are in shape and whatever your company is, it\u2019s always good to get it audited. If you don\u2019t have anything to hide, it\u2019s not a worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not personal,\u201d adds Watkins, hard as nails, \u201cit\u2019s business. Everyone in this industry has an agenda. Accountants, lawyers, people you think you know will keep running up the bill. You have to watch your back on every corner.\u201d\n\nWorse than the money was, of course, the loss of Lopes, which really ended that first, fantastical run. The three had weathered everything together \u2013 the backstabbing, the bankruptcy, the tabloid sensation of Lopes burning down the mansion of her then-football star boyfriend. \u201cLisa was a starter. I don\u2019t start stuff, I don\u2019t believe in arguing with people I don\u2019t know,\u201d says Watkins. \u201cI have a hard exterior, I\u2019m scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was more adventurous,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cI\u2019m a friendly person but if I find out you\u2019re not cool, I get real cold.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d laughs Watkins, \u201cwith Lisa, it depended on the day. She was a Gemini, so she was about seven different people.\u201d Neither Watkins or Thomas drink (\u201cWe\u2019ve done this industry sober; we\u2019re real clear about what we\u2019re doing\u201d), though Lopes did and the three, tight as they were, were known to scrap \u2013 often publicly. Looking back, would they have done anything differently? \u201cCoulda, woulda, shoulda,\u201d says Watkins, her voice at its most slow and sleepy. \u201cIt made us who we are, so at the end of the day, I just remember Lisa as a person, a human being. I miss everything.\u201d\n\nTLC by TLC is out on 30 June"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 08:30:03 GMT", "title": "Alison Moyet: \u2018My biggest disappointment?

There is an annual meeting of its readers, but it looks like those pictures of polar bears on an ice floe\n\nMy friend the film pundit Antonia Quirke was here recently to do a radio interview with me about Steve McQueen. There is another Steve McQueen nowadays, but we were scheduled to talk about the one who drives a Ford Mustang flat out down the bumpy hills of San Francisco in Bullitt. Antonia knows a lot about him. She knows, for example, that the sub-frame of the Mustang had to be especially reinforced, or else McQueen, or whichever stunt driver was doubling for him, would have been converted by the repeated impacts into a half-cooked enchilada.\n\nIndeed, she knows everything about Steve McQueen, but I was able to supply one fantastic fan-fact that she didn\u2019t know. In The Magnificent Seven, when McQueen famously shakes the shotgun cartridges to see if they are packed properly before he and Yul Brynner proceed up Boot Hill in their borrowed wagon, Brynner was so cheesed off at being upstaged that he could hardly be persuaded to proceed anywhere.\n\nDon\u2019t ask me where I read this. All that mattered was that Antonia hadn\u2019t read it, and that I had therefore, right there on the BBC, done to her what McQueen did to the suddenly uncool Yul.\n\nShe took it well, and bravely went on with her job of getting me to quote stuff about McQueen that I had once shovelled into my doomed novel The Remake.

Now the son of a former Guardian journalist is to play Rupert Murdoch in a new play, Ink\n\nAs the son, grandson and great-grandson of admired British newspaper reporters, Bertie Carvel was at high risk of ending up in journalism. He ran from the family tree by going to drama school, but blood has a way of coming out and Carvel will next week continue his rise to the heights of his profession by playing one of the most significant figures in the business he escaped: Rupert Murdoch in Ink, a new stage play by James Graham that dramatises the Australian tycoon\u2019s launch of the Sun in 1969.\n\nFor Carvel, it is the latest in a string of characters that the audience may feel tempted to find unsympathetic. Previous creations include Miss Trunchbull, the psychopathic schoolmistress in the musical version of Roald Dahl\u2019s Matilda, which made Carvel\u2019s name in London and on Broadway, and Simon Foster, the corrupt and adulterous husband of the GP title character in Doctor Foster, a five-part BBC1 psychological thriller that returns for a second series later this year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bertie Carvel as Rupert Murdoch in Ink.\n\nBut the previous work of Carvel and Graham (This House) suggests that audiences should not expect a satirical demolition of Murdoch. During rehearsals, the actor told the Stage that what he most enjoys is \u201cplaying characters that people make moral assumptions about, then introducing doubt and inconsistency into that\u201d. And this is what he hopes to achieve with his version of the newspaper proprietor, a figure about whom many north London theatre-goers will have well-formed prejudices when the lights go down.\n\nMatthew Warchus, who directed Matilda, says: \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be governed by what the audience want or expect but by giving the most physically and psychologically authentic portrait of Murdoch at that time.\u201d\n\nThe actor\u2019s father, John Carvel, the former social affairs editor of the Guardian, says: \u201cIt\u2019s a great part. That\u2019s why he\u2019s doing it. He isn\u2019t supporting or defending Murdoch any more than he was sticking up for demented teachers in Matilda. I\u2019ve never met Murdoch, so I wasn\u2019t able to give Bertie any direct help. But at least Murdoch \u2013 we can say \u2013 believes in newspapers, which is a vanishing enthusiasm.\u201d\n\nAlmeida to stage anarchic comedy about Rupert Murdoch at the Sun Read more\n\nJohn Carvel is the son of Robert Carvel (a celebrated London Evening Standard political editor), whose own father edited the Star newspaper. And while Bertie is named after his grandfather (the diminutive was used in the family from childhood), there was no pressure to extend the ink in the blood to a fourth generation.\n\n\u201cI was actually quite glad that Bertie found something else to do,\u201d says John. \u201cBecause I never gave any thought to the profession I would join, so it impressed me that he struck out from scratch.\u201d\n\nBertie Carvel has said in interviews that, in retrospect, he finds that acting combines the skills of his father\u2019s profession \u2013 researching and explaining \u2013 with, in the exploration of character, that of his mother, a psychologist.\n\nCarvel was educated at London primaries and then the fee-paying University College School. The backstories of major actors often involve tales of infant teachers swooning in surprise at a King Lear played at the age of five. Carvel, though, was a late developer.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll kick me for saying this,\u201d says his dad. \u201cBut I have no memories at all of anything he was in at school. It wasn\u2019t a big theme until university.\u201d\n\nIn his second year at Sussex, reading English, Carvel auditioned for the drama society and was given the lead role of archbishop Thomas Becket, murdered to please the king, in TS Eliot\u2019s Murder in the Cathedral. \u201cHe immediately loved it,\u201d says John Carvel. \u201cAnd it became a passion and then a career.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carvel as Miss Trunchbull (centre), with Adrianna Bertola as Matilda and Lauren Ward as Miss Honey. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian\n\nAt Rada, recalls his father, \u201cBertie seemed to find it quite hard to keep his clothes on in anything he was in. But those days now seem to have gone, thankfully. We now go to see him with a greater sense of calm.\u201d\n\nThe fact that his career began with Murder in the Cathedral has proved prophetic. Eliot\u2019s Becket is a saint who would try the patience of one. And \u2013 in his subsequent professional career \u2013 Carvel has shown a particular talent for playing people who are not easily understood.\n\n\u201cHis speciality, perhaps, has become making monsters and demons rooted and understood,\u201d says Warchus. \u201cHe has a clinical, diagnostic approach to that.\u201d\n\nDoctor Foster writer Mike Bartlett says: \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking through the scripts, Bertie always defends Simon. Not morally, but to ensure that his psychology is coherent and believable. Once he\u2019s satisfied with this, he doesn\u2019t seem to worry what the audience will make of him \u2013 whether that\u2019s a villain or not \u2013 he just plays what the character does, and helps us to understand why.\u201d\n\nWhat is remarkable about his career-transforming performance as Miss Trunchbull is that \u2013 although the character\u2019s wig, bust and dress were vital \u2013 Carvel was able to convince Warchus he could play the role while auditioning in street clothes without props.\n\nAt the Old Vic, where Warchus is artistic director, Carvel recently portrayed an alienated, raging, murderous American working man in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s The Hairy Ape. That role confirmed his unusually dangerous and unpredictable stage presence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carvel as an alienated and raging working man in The Hairy Ape by Eugene O\u2019Neill. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian\n\n\u201cHis natural instinct,\u201d says Warchus, \u201cis to be absolutely unflinchingly the thing that the character is. We are more used to actors who work quite hard to bring the audience with them. But Bertie is almost prepared to be completely independent of the audience, and let them make of him whatever they will. And yet he also has a natural showmanship.\u201d\n\nThe actor has admitted that he \u201casks a thousand questions\u201d in the rehearsal room.\n\nWarchus laughs: \u201cYeah. And, by the way, not only in the rehearsal room, but the auditions, technical rehearsals, previews and even, during the run, by text, email, and phone. But they are all great questions: about his character, the story and the production in general. He\u2019s always seeking a dialogue.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Carvel with Suranne Jones in Doctor Foster. Photograph: Drama Republic/Des Willie\n\nDuring Matilda, recalls Warchus, the bulk of the rehearsal time went on the children, so that Carvel spent days working alone in a room, waiting to be called back to the company: \u201cHe\u2019d come back with a new bit of acrobatics or backstory. Some of it would be great, some of it would be him disappearing down a rabbit hole. But that obsessive worrying away at the role \u2013 which is what he does \u2013 is what yields the results.\u201d\n\nBartlett concurs: \u201cPreparation is hugely important to him. Particularly on television because we don\u2019t have much rehearsal. On Doctor Foster we made up for that by talking through everything as much as possible.\u201d\n\nTo achieve maximum impact, a British actor needs to find standout roles in theatre, TV and movies. Carvel achieved the first with Miss Trunchbull and the second with Simon Foster, but, although he had a small role in Les Mis\u00e9rables, still needs a big film. He is also unusual among leading British actors of his or any other generation in having played almost no Shakespearean roles: his CV contains only a Macbeth at a London fringe theatre as an unknown in 2004. At 40, Richard III, Iago and Leontes remain within reach, and seem to be what his profile needs in the next few years.\n\nWarchus says: \u201cI\u2019ve never asked him about that. He has been very busy. But he has a very wide range. He has a real romantic, almost boyish quality. And he can sing as well. So he\u2019s going to be busy. He\u2019s not going to have time to do everything he could. Imagine the number of questions if he ever did Shakespeare!\u201d\n\nInk is at the Almeida theatre, Islington, London N1, until 5 August."}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:51:50 GMT", "title": "Steve Irwin to be honoured with Hollywood Walk of Fame star", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/24/steve-irwin-to-be-honoured-with-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star", "text": "The late \u2018Crocodile Hunter\u2019 is being recognised for his contribution to the entertainment industry through wildlife documentaries\n\nThe late \u201cCrocodile Hunter\u201d Steve Irwin will be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contribution to the entertainment industry through wildlife documentaries.\n\nIrwin, who died in September 2006, after being struck multiple times by a stingray barb while filming in waters off Port Douglas in far north Queensland, is the only posthumous member of the 2018 television class, which also includes The X-Files actor Gillian Anderson and 1970s Wonder Woman Lynda Carter.\n\nBindi Irwin pays tribute to Crocodile Hunter Steve on 10th anniversary of his death Read more\n\n\u201cBeyond excited to share with you all that we have just received news that Dad will be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame,\u201d his daughter Bindi tweeted on Friday.\n\nA video taken by Australia Zoo shows the moment she and brother Robert, along with mother Terri, reacted joyously to the news.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to Hollywood, guys!\u201d Terri says.\n\nBindi says her father \u201cchanged the world\u201d by bringing his conservation message into people\u2019s homes through his television programs.\n\n\n\nBindi Irwin (@BindiIrwin) Beyond excited to share with you all that we have just received news that Dad will be honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. pic.twitter.com/gjA0DrvVKG\n\nThe star nomination was sponsored by Visit Sunshine Coast.\n\n\u201cSteve has always said that he didn\u2019t care if anyone remembered him, as long as they remembered his message,\u201d Terry Irwin said in a statement from the family\u2019s Australia Zoo conservation site in Western Queensland.\n\n\u201cI truly believe that this recognition for Steve\u2019s achievements will ensure that his message of wildlife conservation is remembered.\u201d"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 11:59:24 GMT", "title": "Mica Paris: To my daughters, I\u2019m the one that cooks and cleans.

My grandfather, the minister, had just stopped preaching and I walked to the front, knees shaking, to sing God Will Open Doors. Holding a note gave me a great feeling \u2013 like an out-of-body experience. From then on, I became the star of the church and my grandmother was akin to my agent, driving me all over the country to attend church singing competitions.\n\nI was very close to my maternal grandparents, who largely brought me and my two older sisters up. This is quite common among Caribbean families \u2013 everyone chips in when the parents are working. My grandparents were very loving, but they were also very traditional and the discipline they instilled was off the chart. Jesus and education was their mantra. We had to adhere to rigid meal times, we had regular choir practice and Bible studies and were expected to speak only when spoken to. By the time I was 15, I was done with all that and left home.\n\nI get my singing voice from my dad, who sounds like Marvin Gaye. He also plays the trumpet and the flute. He\u2019s super-smart and has had three books published, including one about African slaves, which is used in schools. He\u2019s a talented artist, too, and exhibits his work.

I\u2019m close to them both, but Paula is my everything and we talk five times a day. We were thrilled when the first of our three brothers came along seven years after me.

One minute I was a normal girl from south London, the next, everyone was telling me I was great and I started to believe it. I moved to the States to promote my first album: it was the loneliest I\u2019ve been. The only person I knew in New York was my manager \u2013 and even he went home to his family.

After three years of touring and living out of a suitcase, I didn\u2019t feel I could continue working so hard at being a success if there was no one to share it with. For the first time I had something real and powerful \u2013 a home. My husband and I had a child together, but we split up after two years. My fame proved too much for us to handle at such a young age.\n\nI\u2019ve always protected my two girls, Monet, 26, and Russia-Mae, 10, from my world and that\u2019s why they are normal. I didn\u2019t want them to think they had a fast track into fame and fortune via me, so I didn\u2019t bring them to my shows. They\u2019ve only ever known me as someone who cooks and cleans for them and takes them on holiday. I\u2019m their rock when they\u2019re having their moments. I\u2019m a mum to them, not \u201cMica Paris\u201d.\n\n\u2022 Mica\u2019s two new singles from the Ella Fitzgerald songbook are out now on Man in the Moon Records.

But despite a string of earlier successes, the industry hasn\u2019t always been kind to her\n\nI haven\u2019t been to Holly Hunter\u2019s house and, I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that I probably never will, but meeting her in a New York hotel room gave me a tantalizing idea of what kind of host she\u2019d be.\n\nAs I wait outside a suite at the Four Seasons, I can hear the Oscar-winning actor conduct some last-minute feng shui with a publicist, doubling up as furniture re-arranger. When I enter, she\u2019s up on her feet awaiting my arrival and quickly explaining that she wanted us both on the sofa together as the previous set-up was far too much like an \u201cinterrogation\u201d. We sit and she\u2019s offering to serve me tea before talking through why it\u2019s so much better in the UK (\u201cAll I drink is tea but in a way, we just don\u2019t know how to do it\u201d) and offering up career-based empathy (\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a weird job when you have to have to talk about movies that you don\u2019t like\u201d). Needless to say, most interviews don\u2019t tend to start with such informal warmth.\n\nThe Big Sick review - Kumail Nanjiani's real-life romcom is a humane delight Read more\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just pure southern hospitality or it could be the result of a recent career boost that\u2019s lifted the 59-year-old actor out of smaller, often thankless roles, and back into the spotlight. Last year she made an impression, against all odds, in box office behemoth Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (arguably her most widely seen performance to date), she received raves at last year\u2019s Toronto film festival for Netflix indie Strange Weather, cropped up playing Natalie Portman\u2019s mother in Terrence Malick\u2019s music drama Song to Song and her upcoming slate includes a buzzy HBO drama and a much-anticipated Pixar sequel.\n\nBut we\u2019re here to talk about The Big Sick, a charming Judd Apatow-produced romantic comedy that recounts the real life courtship between standup comic turned Silicon Valley star Kumail Nanjiani, playing himself, and his now wife Emily V Gordon, played by Zoe Kazan. As the title suggests, it\u2019s a love story with a twist, the \u201csick\u201d referring to a coma that Emily found herself in after the couple broke up. Hunter plays her mother with enough comic gusto to spark early whispers of awards attention.\n\n\u201cIt goes to this really private and intimate place because Kumail and Emily meant it,\u201d she tells me, tea in hand. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I was attracted to it because it had an authenticity, it had even more than an authenticity, it has an inside track that I felt was compelling.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a rom-com as well as a family drama as well as the story of a comedian trying to get his career started as well as a delicately drawn portrait of Muslim life in America, the latter element arriving at a particularly necessary time. \u201cThat is an unintended, unsought after byproduct of the movie,\u201d Hunter says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were going for that at all but it is, for us, a crucial thing. For us as an audience, boy do we need to hear that.\u201d\n\nActors gotta act. Everything is not going to be the nectar of the gods Holly Hunter\n\nThe film also serves as a valid reminder of Hunter\u2019s scene-stealing skills, curiously absent in recent years. She broke out in the late 80s with the one-two punch of Raising Arizona and an Oscar-nominated turn in Broadcast News but such high-profile roles still weren\u2019t enough to guarantee her more work.\n\n\u201cI remember that when I was in my 30s, a hot age for an actress, lots of offers were coming in but nothing was great and I didn\u2019t work for 18 months,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt was at a really fruitful age and I wanted to work. There was nothing coming down the pipeline that I thought was good and then I got The Piano. I have never been an easy fit. I\u2019m a leading lady character actor, I don\u2019t fit in one slot simply. I\u2019ve always been used to a certain amount of struggle and that prepared me wonderfully for a mature age.\u201d\n\nAn Oscar win for her role as a mute pianist arrived in the same year as a nomination for starring alongside Tom Cruise in The Firm and for a while, the industry was kind and Hunter appeared in serial killer thriller Copycat, Thanksgiving comedy Home for the Holidays and worked with Danny Boyle in A Life Less Ordinary and David Cronenberg in Crash. But by the beginning of the following decade, things started to change.\n\nStrange Weather review \u2013 Holly Hunter takes classic American indie back on the road Read more\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on 40 years of being an actress and of course I\u2019m proud of that,\u201d she tells me. \u201cBut also with that has come the price to be paid for being a female in the movie industry. It\u2019s a hard tightrope to navigate and then to be an older woman, it has its own very special challenges. But I\u2019ve worked even when people didn\u2019t know that I was working. Sometimes it\u2019s very difficult to do a movie that\u2019s good and then have that movie make it to the light of day.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Holly Hunter in Copycat. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/WARNER BROS\n\nIt\u2019s also meant that some of Hunter\u2019s later choices haven\u2019t always been the slam-dunks she might have hoped for. \u201cSometimes I take a movie that I know is not great, it\u2019s not great on the page but I need to work,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes I need to make the money, I need dough. I want to work and so I\u2019ll take something that is compromised in some arena. But it\u2019s like, actors gotta act. It\u2019s the same way in any profession. Everything is not going to be the nectar of the gods.\u201d\n\nIn 2007 she pre-empted other female actors of her age by making the move to television at a time when it was far less common. In Saving Grace, she starred as a dysfunctional detective aided by an angel to mend her destructive ways and for three seasons, she was consistently working, no mean feat for a woman in Hollywood in her late 40s.\n\n\u201cI got seduced into thinking \u2018hey this is my career, this is my life\u2019 and once that ended, I was in cold water again where I was like \u2018ohhh yeah, oh right, I\u2019m playing the mom again,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m talking about a not very well-written mom, sometime who shows up occasionally and is supportive of something. I\u2019ve been reawakened a few times as to the limitations of aging as a woman in the film industry.\u201d\n\nThe Piano rewatched \u2013 re-examining the erotic via sexually charged music lessons Read more\n\nThere\u2019s a self-confessed \u201ccounter-intuitive\u201d decision-making process that\u2019s led Hunter down some unexpected routes (she tells me after Broadcast News she ignored advice and picked a TV movie because she wanted to) but it\u2019s also led her here to a place where she\u2019s excited to be working again as she enters her 60s.\n\nHunter\u2019s sudden visibility is indicative of an industry that\u2019s finally, slowly broadening its sights and allowing multi-faceted older women the opportunities they deserve. She\u2019s currently in the middle of reprising her role as Elastigirl in The Incredibles 2 and Oscar-winning American Beauty screenwriter Alan Ball has cast her as the matriarch in HBO\u2019s multiracial family drama Here, Now alongside Tim Robbins. \u201cAlan doesn\u2019t write anybody that\u2019s not real,\u201d she says, excitedly teasing the show. \u201cEvery character that Alan writes feels like the lead and when that character is on screen, this series is about that person.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough route in an unforgiving industry but Hunter avoids any form of victimhood, even when it comes to the difficult feedback she\u2019s faced throughout her career from casting directors (she\u2019s previously stated that her short stature was often preventative).\n\n\u201cEvery actor gets it,\u201d she says. \u201cEven Brad Pitt I\u2019m sure gets \u2018Oh he\u2019s too good looking for this\u2019 and Brad is like \u2018I can take it down\u2019 so yeah, I\u2019m no exception.\u201d"}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:00:24 GMT", "title": "Sofie Hagen: \u2018I was a chubby, white four-year-old, talking like Will Smith\u2019", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/23/sofie-hagen-funniest-thing-will-smith", "text": "The Danish comedian and podcast host on the things that make her laugh the most, from Will Smith to The Green Butchers\n\nThe funniest standup I\u2019ve ever seen\n\nIrish comic Alison Spittle.

We've lived here for 30 years and there's been two fires since the cladding was fitted and they've all been contained.\n\n\"I think there has been a big cock-up. I feel terrible.

The All Blacks were very direct, better than us at the breakdown and we missed opportunities - all things we can fix.\n\n\"We created chances and shifted the ball pretty well. They didn't come out and play champagne rugby, they were very direct off nine. We were looking to get the upper hand up front, but in fairness to them they got it today.\"\n\nLions captain Peter O'Mahony: \"We are happy with the opportunities we created. Our discipline wasn't where it should be, we conceded double figures in penalties.\n\n\"We have to regroup, have a good look at that and move on now.

It has led to it being referred to \"the most neglected crisis in the world\".\n\nSo many people have been displaced that northern Cameroon's only official refugee camp, in Minawao, has already been \"overwhelmed\" with people, according to Alberto Jodra, head of Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Cameroon.\n\nIt means that many of those who have fled violence in their home villages and towns are still finding themselves caught between armed groups like Boko Haram and the armies of several countries.\n\nThat same violence prevents aid agencies like MSF reaching those most in need.\n\n\"We know that people who have been displaced are being caught in the crossfire,\" Mr Jodra told the BBC. \"From time to time we see victims, but we have not got access to these places.\"\n\nImage copyright Chris de Bode/Red Cross Image caption Ali, centre, is 15, but is very small for his age due to malnutrition.

But this is something that has been building since 2009, and significantly getting worse since 2014.\"\n\nIt is, de Bode says, a desperate place - both for those who had fled their own homes, and those who lived there already.\n\n\"What I felt when I was there is the enormous burden, not only on the people who fled the conflict but also on the people who receive these people,\" de Bode said.\n\n\"The family might have something for the small children, but nothing for the older ones. They are sent to market to beg.\n\n\"To have one meal a day is an achievement.\"\n\nHowever, there is still hope in the most desperate of situations - even where you least expect it.

The family were told she was terminally ill.\n\n\"The thought that she wouldn't be here was unbearable,\" remembers Gilli.\n\n\"She died at home at 1:30 in the afternoon, with me and her dad.\"\n\nGilli's other children - including Niamh's twin, Zach - were at school or college.\n\nBut through the blur of upset and sorrow, Gilli knew one thing clearly: she wanted to donate Niamh's eyes, the only part of the little girl unaffected by disease.\n\nOrgan donation is very important to Gilli's family - as a baby, one of Niamh's brothers had a heart transplant after contracting a serious chest infection.\n\nShe needed to act fast. By 5pm she was in touch with Arka Original Funerals - a Brighton company that is part of a movement in the UK to re-personalise and de-industrialise death, dying and funerals.\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nWhen funeral director Cara Mair arrived with her colleague, Sarah Clarke-Kent, to pick Niamh up, there was no heavy-duty, black plastic body bag to zip her into.\n\nShe was carried away on a stretcher with a pillow, cotton shroud, and a soft felt covering appliqu\u00e9d with large leaves.\n\n\"Removing someone from their home is such a hard thing for families to witness,\" says Cara.\n\n\"It's important to have something of beauty to wrap them in. A person may have died, but it's still their shell, their vessel.\"\n\nFind out more\n\nNiamh was taken quickly to Arka's premises, where her eyes were removed by a medical technician that same evening.\n\n\"Sarah stayed with Niamh while the procedure was done,\" says Gilli.\n\n\"That was a real gift, because then I knew it had been done really respectfully.\n\n\"The man operating told Sarah that Niamh's eyes were beautiful and in great condition, so they would definitely be given to someone else. I was really pleased to hear that.\"\n\nThe next day, Niamh was taken back home.\n\nKeeping a body at home before a funeral is rare in the UK, but it is not illegal.\n\nThe most important consideration is temperature. Some funeral companies supply air conditioning units in the summer months to keep a body cool, and electric cold blankets may be used as well.\n\nBut in Niamh's case, temperature was not an issue. It was November, so she was placed in a room at home with the windows open.\n\n\"She stayed there, lying on an armchair with her blankets and her cushions,\" remembers Gilli.\n\n\"I couldn't possibly have left her somewhere else. It just didn't feel right. She'd just turned nine years old - it still felt as though she was part of me.\"\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson Image caption Niamh and her twin brother Zach aged five - a year before her diagnosis\n\nNiamh would remain at home for nearly three weeks, with her eyes closed.\n\n\"We try and slow things down for loved ones, to give time to digest the news of a death. We don't have a prescribed way of doing things,\" says Cara.\n\nIn the days Niamh was at home, Gilli spent a lot of time with her.\n\n\"I was able to wash her. And dress her in her favourite things. The main thing for me was to make her death real.\n\n\"If Niamh had just disappeared out of the house, and then a coffin had arrived and I never saw her again, I'd still be searching...\"\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nGilli trusted her own instincts on this because - almost unbelievably - she had already experienced the loss of two other children.

She had learned some lessons from her first bereavement but the funeral service still seemed all wrong.\n\n\"It was too wordy for a tiny baby. And the funeral director had put in a lot of religion, which had nothing to do with me,\" she says.\n\nGilli remembered a conversation she had with Niamh before she died.\n\n\"We were walking to the park with her twin, and she said she wanted to be buried. She didn't like the idea of fire, and was adamant about that.\"\n\nBut Gilli hated the idea of a graveyard - dark, and foreboding, and so unlike her shy little girl.\n\nThe family settled on a woodland burial. Gilli was not sure she wanted to put her daughter in a coffin, so Arka advised her that Niamh could be buried only in a shroud.\n\nBut at the last minute, her father changed his mind, and Niamh was placed in a wicker coffin.\n\n\"In the time she'd been at home since she'd died, she hadn't really changed very much,\" remembers Sarah Clarke-Kent. \"She looked very peaceful and small.\"\n\nImage copyright Gilli Davidson\n\nNiamh loved dogs.

A kiwi in Wiltshire is a testament to the homesick New Zealand soldiers once stationed nearby.\n\nHere are the stories behind some of the enormous symbols which have become part of the country's very fabric.\n\nThe mane attractions\n\nImage copyright National Trust Image caption Is it a horse or a dragon? It is said that when King Arthur awakes the hill figure will rise up and dance\n\nThe Uffington Horse, in the Berkshire Downs, is considered the oldest hill figure of them all. Carved in the Iron Age, there has been an unbroken chain of people caring for this prehistoric monument for the past 3,000 years.\n\nSoil tests show the horse has been there since between 1200 BC and 800 BC. There are plenty of legends associated with both the figure and with nearby Dragon Hill. There have even been suggestions the horse is in fact a dragon.\n\nOne tale is that King Arthur will one day wake when England is in peril. When Arthur rouses (although legend has it he fought against the English, so it would seem unlikely), the Uffington horse will rise up and dance on Dragon Hill. A similar creature is featured on old Celtic coins from 150 BC.\n\nIn fact depictions of horses are fairly common, with at least 24 across Britain - although some can no longer be seen.\n\nHistorian Dr Mark Hows, who studies hill figures, believes the figure represents the Celtic goddess Epona, protector of horses, and all the other horses are copies of - or at least inspired by - the Uffington original.\n\nHowever, only the Osmington White Horse - a 260ft (79m) figure which prances across the South Dorset Downs - has a rider.\n\nIt was carved in 1808 in honour of King George III, who was a regular visitor to nearby Weymouth. The figure underwent something of a trial in 1989 when the BBC programme Challenge Anneka decided to restore it - but ended up damaging it.\n\nIt was properly redone in time for the 2012 Olympics, when it could be seen by television viewers of sailing events held in Weymouth harbour.\n\nImage copyright August Schwerdfeger Image caption The Osmington White Horse was carved in honour of King George III\n\nThe rather rude giant\n\nImage caption Although undoubtedly \"anatomically impressive\", the giant's origins are uncertain\n\nOne of the most famous hill figures is the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, which Historic England describes as \"bold and anatomically impressive\".\n\nThe 180ft-tall (55m) turf-cut figure of a naked man waving a club has prompted considerable debate over its origins.\n\nEarly antiquarians linked him with the Anglo-Saxon deity Helis, while others believe he is the classical hero Hercules. Still others posit he was carved during the English Civil War as a parody of Oliver Cromwell, although he is commonly believed to have some association with a pagan fertility cult.\n\nA further layer of mystery was added in the 1980s when a survey revealed anomalies which suggested he originally wore a cloak and was stood over a disembodied head. There has also been a suggestion his significant anatomy is in fact the result of merging a smaller penis with a representation of his navel during a re-cut by the Victorians.\n\nThe giant has caused a few hot flushes in the past. Prudish politicians led to a version on a brewer's logo having his modesty preserved in a Houses of Parliament bar by the addition of a paper fig leaf.\n\nAnd keeping with a political theme, pranksters recently attached giant letters spelling out \"Theresa\".\n\nImage copyright Cerne Abbas Brewery Image caption A photocopied fig leaf was added to the beer pump clip in a Houses of Parliament bar\n\nAnother giant\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nCerne Abbas is not the only place to boast a giant on its hillside. Wilmington in East Sussex has its own \"Long Man\" - but he is a more modest sort than his Dorset cousin.\n\nFor many years up until the 19th Century, the Long Man was only visible when the sun was in a certain position, but since 1874 its shape has been marked out in yellow bricks.\n\nThe Sussex Archaeological Society describes him as \"the mysterious guardian of the South Downs\" and says there are many theories about his origin.\n\nSome are convinced he is prehistoric, others believe he is the work of an artistic monk from the nearby priory, which would date him from between the 11th and 15th Centuries.\n\nRoman coins bearing a similar figure suggest he belonged to the 4th Century and there may be plausible parallels with a helmeted figure found on Anglo-Saxon ornaments.\n\nWe may never know.\n\nKiwi in camp\n\nImage copyright Jonathonjosh1 Image caption The Bulford kiwi photographed in 2013, following restoration and maintenance by a local scout group\n\nIn 1919, following the end of World War One, officers commanding restless and homesick New Zealand troops wanted a task to distract their men and keep them out of trouble.\n\nPerhaps inspired by Wiltshire's large number of chalk hill figures - it has 13 horse figures alone - they despatched the soldiers to carve a kiwi in the hillside above Bulford Military Camp.\n\nIt was designed by Sgt Maj Percy Cecil Blenkarne from a sketch of a stuffed kiwi specimen in the British Museum.\n\nThe figure, the body of which measures 1.5 acres (6,100 m sq), was completed shortly before the troops went home.\n\nIt was then looked after by the Kiwi shoe polish company as an advert, until it was covered during World War Two in case it was used as a landmark by enemy aircraft.\n\nAlthough the carving was neglected and nearly disappeared in the 1970s, it was restored close to its former glory in 1986 by a local scout group - which changed its name to the 1st Bulford (Kiwi) Scouts. It has now been given protected status.\n\nImage copyright Kiwi Polish Image caption A postcard from about 1919 shows the kiwi shortly after completion\n\nOther remnants of military life can be found on Fovant Down, between Salisbury and Shaftesbury, where military insignia are carved.\n\nFive of the Fovant Badges were created by soldiers during World War One, including the rising sun of the Australian and Commonwealth Military Forces, the Post Office Rifles and the Devonshire Regiment. The ACMF also had men stationed at the nearby Hurdcott army camp, where they cut a map of Australia.\n\nThe badges belonging to the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry and the Wiltshire Regiment were built in the early 1950s by the Fovant Home Guard, while the Royal Corps of Signals cut their badge in 1970 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the corps.\n\nImage copyright Historic England Archive Image caption The YMCA emblem, which is not a regimental badge, was allowed to fade away in 2005 and can no longer be seen\n\nA roaring success\n\nImage copyright Alamy\n\nBut to find the largest of England's hill figures, one has to travel to Bedfordshire.\n\nThe giant 147m (483 ft) long lion was carved in 1933 to indicate the location of Whipsnade wildlife park.\n\nThousands of man hours over 18 months were spent digging the creature out of the hillside with pick-axes.\n\nHowever, the outbreak of World War Two resulted in it being covered up again, amid fears it could help guide German bombers to the nearby towns of Luton and Dunstable.\n\nTroops were brought in to help camouflage the landmark with brushwood, nets and manure.\n\nAfter the war the lion was uncovered and spruced up again in 2005.\n\nHe is now visible for several miles across the Dunstable Downs."}, {"published": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:26:24 GMT", "title": "Eid: How to handle the tough questions at family gatherings", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-40377764", "text": "The holy Islamic fasting month of Ramadan is coming to an end this weekend. For many Muslims around the world, it's the one time of the year that they return to their hometowns and gather with their extended family for a catch-up and feast.\n\nBut as Christine Franciska of the BBC's Indonesian Service explains, for many young people, Eid al-Fitr's family gatherings are not as pleasant as they seem.\n\nIt's the time when aunties, uncles, and older relatives who you rarely see ask you \"scary questions\".\n\n\"Who's your boyfriend (or girlfriend) now?\" \"When are you getting married?\" \"Why are you looking a bit...fat?\"\n\n\"It is not comfortable at all,\" said Indonesian Mochamad Fadly Anwar on Facebook. \"And I think it crosses the line. I am like, hey mind your own business.\"\n\n\"Those questions are legendary...\" said another user.\n\nImage caption One way of handling the awkwardness?\n\nIndonesian psychologist Roslina Verauli says these questions are part and parcel of collective cultures, and a way for older relatives to get close to you.\n\n\"Don't immediately think that they're pressuring you. If you have an awareness of our culture, you won't get easily offended,\" she says.\n\n\"We need to get together and feel close to each other. That is why we ask each other those very personal questions because we feel close to each other even though you may not have seen those relatives in 20 years, or only meet them once a year.\"\n\nBut this doesn't mean those questions are appropriate, she says - it can still be unpleasant discussing personal matters with people you rarely meet.\n\nSo here are guidelines from the experts on how to avoid offending one of your relatives at this year's family gatherings.\n\nChit chat - clich\u00e9 but necessary\n\n\"How's the food?\"\n\n\"Your new outfit looks fabulous!\"\n\nThese are clich\u00e9s, but are very useful phrases in awkward situations when you don't know much about your relative's life.\n\n\"Don't ask for details first. Ask their opinions on things,\" says Mrs Verauli.\n\n\"This is a bridge to move to more personal questions. If you want to get close to a relative, have your clich\u00e9 questions ready for the family gathering.\"\n\nAvoid asking children achievement based questions\n\nRemember who you are talking to. You should ask different questions to relatives in different age groups.\n\nWhen chatting with children, Mrs Verauli explains, ask them about their activities and hobbies.\n\n\"Don't ask 'did you win that competition last month?'. It will hurt them, because for elementary school children, questions about achievement and if they're doing well at school are sensitive questions.\"\n\nHow about teenagers?\n\n\"Don't ask 'do you have a boyfriend or girlfriend'. They are sure to be very shy answering that even if they have one,\" says Mrs Verauli.\n\n\"Whether they are dating and if they are popular with their peers are important matters for teenagers and is a sensitive issue best avoided.\"\n\nFor young adults, marriage questions are a no-no, as are questions about jobs and wages especially for those who feel they haven't met the expectations of their family or culture.\n\n\"In an early adulthood (20-30 year olds) starting a career and having a spouse are some of the expected things they should have achieved by that age. If you ask them directly about this, it could hurt them.\"\n\nBut asking about the career of your relatives in their 30s and 40s is a good one, because at that stage, usually, their career is more stable, she adds.\n\nAs for your elderly relatives, start by talking about positive things such as their health and their \"youthful\" appearance. Talking about sickness makes them sad, points out Mrs Verauli.\n\nHow to answer?\n\nSo what if you get questions like the dreaded \"are you getting married?\"\n\nPsychologist Pingkan Rumondor from Bina Nusantara University says the best way to respond is to smile and tell the truth.\n\n\"Answer it as comfortably as you can. If you feel like it's too personal, just simply smile and say I don't know, and try to get away.\"\n\n\"There is no obligation to answer.\"\n\nYou can read the news in Bahasa on the BBC Indonesian website"}, {"published": "Sat, 24 Jun 2017 00:47:33 GMT", "title": "Reality Check: How many people are affected by May's offer?", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40382761", "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nTheresa May told other EU leaders on Thursday that a new \"UK settled status\" would grant EU migrants who had lived in the UK for five years, rights to stay and access to health, education and other benefits.\n\nShe said the proposals depend on other EU states guaranteeing UK citizens the same rights.\n\nSo, how many EU nationals live in the UK and where do they come from?

Principally, they had Nakarawa, an old friend come back to haunt the visitors.\n\nIt was a frenetic day, a madcap Test. When Josua Tuisova, the Toulon wing known as The Bus, obliterated Damien Hoyland in the tackle early on, there was already a sense that Fiji were on to something special.\n\nIn the mayhem of the opening minutes, Tevita Cavubati, the Fijian lock, was yellow-carded and followed sharply into the sin bin by Scotland's Josh Strauss and then, a third man walked - Peni Ravai, the Fiji loosehead getting done for pulling down a maul.\n\nFiji had a three-point lead at that stage, but it soon vanished when Ford crashed over from a line-out maul.\n\nHooker Ford had become Scotland's record cap-holder with his 110th international appearance and it was his third try of the series - having scored just two for his country prior to the tour.\n\nJackson converted, but this was short respite for Scotland. Volavola's boot made it 7-6 as the visitors struggled awfully to gain any semblance of control. They threw risky passes, got turned over, missed a huge number of tackles and sent up distress flares in much of what they did.\n\nNakarawa was signed by Townsend at Glasgow and was pivotal in their 2015 Pro12 win\n\nThe sense that they were in serious trouble increased significantly when Fiji cut loose before the break. Clermont's Yato - a colossal presence in their back row - started it all with a howitzer tackle, Hoyland being the victim again.\n\nThen it was Nakarawa who got the locals to their feet when he sucked in Scottish defenders and pulled off an outrageous offload that had Scotland scrambling forlornly.\n\nThey swept left, Patrick Osborne barrelling through Jackson before linking with Yato, who ran on to score. Devastating.\n\nAt the break it was 11-7 to Fiji and they were good value for it. Scotland lost Duncan Taylor at half-time and Townsend reworked things. Greig Tonks came on at full-back, Jackson went to 10 and Peter Horne moved to 12. Gordon Reid also replaced Alex Allan.\n\nNone of it worked. Scotland continued to turn over ball and could not live with Fiji when they got on the front foot, which was often. More slackness in defence cost Scotland three more points from the boot of Volavola. Townsend went to the bench again. Brown, Zander Fagerson and Hamish Watson all appeared with half an hour to play.\n\nBriefly, it looked like Scotland might get a grip on the Fijians when Jackson picked up at the side of a maul and strolled over. When he converted his first Scotland try, it was level at 14-14.\n\nThe maddening thing for Townsend was that they fell behind so quickly, Volavola landing another penalty.\n\nJackson levelled it again but that set the scene for Nakarawa to take on, and beat, three Scottish defenders before presenting a pass - it was forward, but there was no TMO to check it - to Seniloli, who sprinted away to score.\n\nVolavola converted and added another penalty after Tuisova had once again turned on the power to drive his team forward.\n\nBrown scored a first international try off another line-out maul with four minutes left to play, but Scotland toiled badly as they attempted to pull it back. They could not. In truth, they did not deserve to.\n\nFiji: Murimurivalu, Tuisova, Vulivuli, Vatubua, Osborne, Volavola, Vularika, Ravai, Koto Vuli, Tawake, Cavubati, Nakarawa, Waqaniburotu, Yato, Qera.\n\nReplacements: Tuapati, Veitayaki, Ducivaki, Nabou, Dawai, Seniloli, Stewart, Masilevu.\n\nScotland: Jackson, Hoyland, Grigg, Taylor, Visser, Horne, Pyrgos, Allan, Ford, Nel, Swinson, J.

Vi har v\u00e6rt i utallige m\u00f8ter med b\u00e5de ordf\u00f8rer og havnesjefen, og sagt at vi vil ha forutsigbarhet. Og ikke bli utsatt for en kostnadsoverf\u00f8ring fra de fallerte prosjektene fra havnesjefen.\n\n\u00abNordnorske kraftsalver\u00bb\n\nHurtigruten har n\u00e5 en intensjonsavtale om tomt og arealer i Eidkjosen, og har begynt arbeidet for flytting, p\u00e5peker Skjeldam:\n\n\u2013 Vi har v\u00e6rt veldig tydelig p\u00e5 konsekvensen for Troms\u00f8. N\u00e5 tar vi handling sj\u00f8l, fordi vi er lei av \u00e5 h\u00f8re mangel p\u00e5 gjennomf\u00f8ringsevne, og tomme ord.

Jeg har nettopp kj\u00f8pt meg en liten b\u00e5t for \u00e5 kunne dra p\u00e5 \u00f8yturer p\u00e5 fjorden med mine barn. Den er kj\u00f8pt over disk hos en norsk forhandler, jeg har betalt moms og forsikring, og den er registrert i sm\u00e5b\u00e5tregistret.\n\nDen er enkel, rimelig, drivstoffgjerrig, stilleg\u00e5ende og letth\u00e5ndterlig, og perfekt for hyggelige turer til flotte rekreasjonsomr\u00e5der langs kysten.\n\nNoen velger \u00e5 kalle b\u00e5ttypen en vannskuter, basert p\u00e5 fremdriftssystem og sittestilling. Tidligere har vannskutere v\u00e6rt underlagt merkelige restriksjoner, som i praksis gjorde dem ubrukelige til alt annet enn herjekj\u00f8ring og lek i b\u00f8lgene langt til havs. Disse restriksjonene ble opphevet i v\u00e5res og jeg s\u00e5 fram til \u00e5 kunne benytte min lovlig anskaffede b\u00e5t til fine turopplevelser i sommer.\n\nMen n\u00e5 har dere lokalpolitikere i det ganske land tydeligvis lite annet \u00e5 bekymre dere over, for det er startet et voldsomt korstog mot vannskutere, med bakgrunn i en rekke underlige argumenter. Resultatet er at kommunene konkurrerer i \u00e5 v\u00e6re raskest ute med \u00e5 forby denne b\u00e5ttypen i sine farvann, noe som igjen gj\u00f8r det meget uoversiktlig og upraktisk \u00e5 ferdes p\u00e5 sj\u00f8en.\n\nDet er startet et voldsomt korstog mot vannskutere.\n\nFor ordens skyld, jeg er ogs\u00e5 en ivrig kajakkpadler, seiler og brettseiler. Jeg liker fred og ro p\u00e5 sj\u00f8en. Jeg har irritert meg over barn som kj\u00f8rer rundt og rundt i sm\u00e5 joller med 9.9 hk motor hver eneste sommerkveld i uthavnene og \u00abtror det er lov\u00bb, og jeg har irritert meg over voksne som bruker \u00abv\u00e5r\u00bb lille fjord utenfor hytta som treningsbane for vannskutere.\n\nMen samtidig tror jeg at det er mer enn nok plass til at alle kan nyte sj\u00f8en p\u00e5 sin m\u00e5te, uten at overmakten m\u00e5 gripe inn og diskriminere spesielle fart\u00f8ystyper. Vannskuter er en fantastisk farkost for \u00e5 oppleve skj\u00e6rg\u00e5rden.\n\nDet handler som med alt annet om \u00e5 vise hensyn og samtidig ha takh\u00f8yde for andres interesser. S\u00f8rg for at reglene for \u00e5 ferdes p\u00e5 sj\u00f8en er enkle, oversiktlige, konsekvente og kanskje mulige \u00e5 h\u00e5ndheve, s\u00e5 er mye gjort.\n\nMen det er selvsagt mer lettvint for dere politikere \u00e5 slenge dere p\u00e5 totalforbuds-hylekoret med noen meget billige og tynne argumenter:\n\n\u00abVannskutere st\u00f8yer.\u00bb Nei det gj\u00f8r de ikke. En moderne vannscooter er langt mer stilleg\u00e5ende enn de fleste andre motorb\u00e5ter, inkludert sm\u00e5joller med p\u00e5henger, store yachter, og trivelige sakteg\u00e5ende t\u00f8ff-t\u00f8ff-snekker.\n\nEn moderne vannskuter er langt mer stilleg\u00e5ende enn de fleste andre motorb\u00e5ter.\n\n\u00abVannskutere er ikke nyttige.\u00bb Nei vel, men hvor mange lystb\u00e5ter er nyttige? Hvis man da ikke ser nytteverdien i naturopplevelser, rekreasjon og avkobling.\n\n\u00abVannskutere g\u00e5r fort.\u00bb Nei, men noen av dem kan g\u00e5 fort. Det kan ogs\u00e5 en sportsb\u00e5t eller en RIB. Ferdsel p\u00e5 sj\u00f8en er uansett regulert av blant annet sj\u00f8veisregler og fartsgrenser. P\u00e5 samme m\u00e5te som de fleste motorsykler og personbiler har en toppfart som er mye h\u00f8yere enn fartsgrensene p\u00e5 veien. Men de er ikke totalforbudt av den grunn.\n\n\u00abForskjellen p\u00e5 vannskutere og fritidsb\u00e5ter er at vannskutere for eksempel kan svinge og snu raskere, samt kan kj\u00f8re n\u00e6rmere land.\u00bb Dette er min favoritt, servert av Lan Marie Nguyen Berg. Ferdsel n\u00e6r land er allerede regulert av f.eks. badeb\u00f8yer, 5-knops fartsgrense, og generelle sj\u00f8veisregler. Og at et fart\u00f8y er man\u00f8vreringsdyktig og letth\u00e5ndterlig er alts\u00e5 en god grunn til \u00e5 forby det?\n\nDet er mer enn nok plass til at alle kan nyte sj\u00f8en p\u00e5 sin m\u00e5te.\n\nN\u00e5 har det seg slik at jeg disponerer en b\u00e5t til, som jeg da blir n\u00f8dt til \u00e5 benytte til rekreasjon langs kysten i sommer.\n\nB\u00c5TEN: EN klassisk speedb\u00e5t som politikerne mener er mer egnet i skj\u00e6rg\u00e5rden enn vannskuteren.\n\nDenne b\u00e5ten er en klassisk sportsb\u00e5t med en 20 \u00e5r gammel diger p\u00e5hengsmotor p\u00e5 hekken.\n\nDen br\u00e5ker mye mer enn min vannskuter. Den kan kj\u00f8re dobbelt s\u00e5 fort som min vannskuter. Den er mye vanskeligere \u00e5 h\u00e5ndtere og kj\u00f8re trygt enn min vannskuter. Den forurenser mye mer og bruker mye mer drivstoff enn min vannskuter.

Det er henne dei fotograferer.\n\nDette er lille Tonje, barnestjerna, ho som V\u00e5rt Land seinare skal skildre som ein hjarteknusar som \u00abtok torg-folket med storm\u00bb.\n\nKorleis enda ho opp her, som kjendis i Kristen-Noreg?\n\n\u2013 Vi var ein familie som misjonerte om Jesus, seier Tonje.\n\nNRK m\u00f8ter Tonje Tornes p\u00e5 kaf\u00e8. Endeleg fortel ho om livet etter \u00aboppveksten p\u00e5 TV\u00bb. Foto: Maren Kvamme Hagen / NRK\n\n35 \u00e5r seinare sit ho p\u00e5 ein kaf\u00e9 i Oslo, tyggjer p\u00e5 ein sandwich og drikk kaffi. Det blonde h\u00e5ret ligg laust over skuldrene, ein jamn dur av trivielle samtalar fr\u00e5 borda rundt skapar kontrast til livshistoria som blir fortalt. Ho snakkar opent, men veg orda sine med omhug. I \u00e5ret ho fyller 40 har Tonje bestemt seg for \u00e5 fortelje om livet som barnestjerne. Om korleis ein lengsel etter Gud prega oppveksten hennar. Om korleis ho jakta p\u00e5 Jesus \u2013 og p\u00e5 eigen identitet. Minna er blanda med ting ho er blitt fortalt og ting ho har lest i avisene.\n\nTonje Larsen, sju \u00e5r\n\n\u00abDette er Line, Kim, og s\u00e5 er det nokon som g\u00f8ymer seg her\u2026. Det er Tonje.\u00bb\n\nDet er beste sendetid p\u00e5 NRK1 i 1984. Statskanalen held ein sterk posisjon i Noreg, sj\u00f8lv om kringkastingsmonopolet offisielt er brote og kabel- og satellitt-TV-en er p\u00e5 veg inn. Musikkprogrammet \u00abHusker du\u00bb, med Odd Grythe som programleiar, er 1980-talets \u00abBeat for Beat\u00bb, gullrekkjeprogram nummer \u00e9in. Artistar blir invitert i studio for \u00e5 prate om livet og syngje saman med publikum, som hovudsakleg er i pensjonistalder. Her blir kjendisar laga.\n\nTonje er sju \u00e5r gammal.\n\nPappa Rune er kjent rockevokalist, Ten Sing- og gospelstjerne. Han skal seinare bli A-kjendis med TV-programmet \u00abLollipop\u00bb, men no presenterer han borna sine, familiegruppa, p\u00e5 rekkje og rad: Storesyster Line og vesle Tonje i kjolar sydd av mamma, Edle. Pappa og bror Kim har p\u00e5 seg heilkvite dongeriantrekk.\n\n\u00abMen dette er ikke dine?\u00bb Seier Odd Grythe og peikar mot koret.\n\n\u00abNei,\u00bb seier Rune Larsen og ler. Han introduserer koristane. \u00ab\u2026 og det der er Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8.\u00bb\n\nP\u00e5 dette tidspunktet er Tonje faktisk st\u00f8rre kjendis enn Kyrkjeb\u00f8, som snart skal sl\u00e5 gjennom. P\u00e5 80-talet omtalar journalistar henne ofte som dagmamma eller korist for Tonje.\n\nOdd Grythe er kledd i gr\u00e5 dress, han b\u00f8yer seg ned mot sju\u00e5ringen. \u00abOg du skal synge for oss, Tonje? Det har pappa sagt at du skal gj\u00f8re. Hva skal du synge?\u00bb\n\n\u00abKan du si meg hvem jeg \u00e6\u00e6\u00e6r,\u00bb svarar Tonje p\u00e5 bergensdialekt.\n\n\u00abDet kan jeg si, du er Tonje,\u00bb seier Grythe.\n\nBarnelatter. Scena blir rydda, koristane og familiegruppa trekkjer seg ut. Igjen st\u00e5r Tonje og pappa. Ho f\u00e5r ein h\u00f8g krakk, klatrar opp framfor mikrofonen. Rune tel opp. \u00abB\u00e6b\u00e6b\u00e6, b\u00e6b\u00e6b\u00e6, kan du si meg hvem jeg er?\u00bb Syng han.\n\n\u00abJa, det kan jeg, ja, det kan jeg. Du er et lammm!\u00bb\n\nTonje syng skr\u00e5sikkert og konsentrert, smilande, medan ho ser opp p\u00e5 pappa. Ho verkar trygg, vant til \u00e5 vere p\u00e5 scena. Kua og grisen f\u00e5r kvart sitt vers. S\u00e5 stiller pappa sp\u00f8rsm\u00e5let om kven som har skapt alle dyr. \u00abKan du si meg hvem det er?\u00bb\n\nDet kan Tonje. Ho rettar ein peikefinger mot himmelen. \u00abDet er v\u00e5r Gud.\u00bb\n\nP\u00e5 dette tidspunktet har Tonje allereie mottatt fanbrev i to \u00e5r, fr\u00e5 folk som vil bli hennar ven. Ho svarar dei pliktoppfyllande. Det skal g\u00e5 lang tid f\u00f8r ho skj\u00f8nnar at dette ikkje er kvardagskost for andre barn. Tonje fortel:\n\n\u2013 Det var eg som insisterte p\u00e5 \u00e5 bli med opp p\u00e5 scena. Men eg veit ikkje om eg forstod kva det innebar. F\u00f8rst d\u00e5 eg blei med i ei teatergruppe, skj\u00f8nte eg at det var forskjell p\u00e5 \u00e5 opptre for familiar og barn i n\u00e6rmilj\u00f8et, og p\u00e5 NRK for heile det norske folk.\n\nFamilien Larsen p\u00e5 scena.

Ho syng i kyrkjer og bedehus, dyreparken i Kristiansand og p\u00e5 Oase, eit stort stemne der fleire tusen kristne er til stade. Tonje f\u00e5r ein st\u00f8rre plass i offentlegheita.\n\nI media blir familien Larsen presentert som eit f\u00f8rebilete for andre. Julaftan 1985 er Tonje p\u00e5 framsida av Aftenposten under tittelen \u00abJulens sentrale budskap: Kj\u00e6rlighet.\u00bb Sm\u00e5 barnehender foldar seg i b\u00f8n, med pappa som st\u00f8tte. Dette er ein artikkel ho hugsar spesielt godt, for eit av bileta blir seinare \u00e5 finne i familiens hus i Bergen. Journalisten skildrar Tonje som ein \u00abliten lesehest som helst sitter i sofakroken med en haug b\u00f8ker. Spennende historier fra Bibelen med farverike tegninger. Ispedd et og annet Donald-blad.\u00bb Dette er \u00abingen helt vanlig familie\u00bb: Pappa er kjendis og borna er scenevande. I biletet som blir teikna av familien, st\u00e5r \u00abbibelsamtaler rundt bordet, (\u2026) h\u00f8ytlesning, aftenb\u00f8nn p\u00e5 sengekanten og korsang\u00bb sentralt i kvardagen. Tonje fordjupar seg i teikneseriar og b\u00f8n. Ho tenkjer seinare at fokuset p\u00e5 henne som den vesle, s\u00f8te jenta er ein m\u00e5te \u00e5 dekkje over at ho ikkje eigentleg kan syngje.\n\nDei to neste \u00e5ra leier Tonje NRK-programmet \u00abJulegleder i Grieghallen\u00bb saman med far sin. \u00c5 opptre med stjerner som Carola, Sissel Kyrkjeb\u00f8 og ein julenissekledd Arne Bendiksen er ein naturleg del av livet. Ho dansar til og med i pauseinnslaget til den internasjonale finalen av Melodi Grand Prix i 1986. Framleis er ho barn, enda ikkje inne i ten\u00e5ra.\n\nTonje Larsen, fjortis\n\nDet glade 80-tal blir til emosjonelt 90-tal. Ei meir pessimistisk tids\u00e5nd sl\u00e5r inn. Berlinmuren finst ikkje meir, den kalde krigen er over. Kjernefamilien er i endring, skilsmissestatistikken i Noreg toppar seg med vel 10.000 skilsmisser. Ironigenerasjonen gjer sitt inntog.\n\nTonje kjenner seg mindre trygg p\u00e5 scena.\n\n\u2013 Det inderlege som familien min representerte p\u00e5 80-talet, blei klammare p\u00e5 eit vis. Eg visste ikkje korleis eg skulle oppf\u00f8re meg i det nye ironiske klimaet. Eg mista sjarmen, gl\u00f8ymde korleis eg skrudde han p\u00e5. Eller s\u00e5 turte eg ikkje lenger.\n\nTonje og pappa Rune Larsen i TV-programmet \u00abJulegleder\u00bb i 1987. Dei leia programmet saman to \u00e5r p\u00e5 rad. Artistar som Sigvart Dagsland, Karoline Kr\u00fcger og Arne Bendiksen dukka opp. Foto: NRK\n\nHo syng p\u00e5 TV siste gong i 1990, i pappa og Tor Endresens nye TV-program \u00abLollipop\u00bb. Museflettene er bytta ut med hestehale, store briller dekkjer ansiktet. Tonje er plutseleg sjenert, utilpass. Familien g\u00e5r fr\u00e5 \u00e5 vere ein familie som heile Kristen-Noreg kjenner, til \u00e5 bli ein familie der pappa er A-kjendis. Fotografar ringer p\u00e5 d\u00f8ra til familiens hus i Bergen. Lollipop, lollipop, syng ungdommar n\u00e5r Tonje g\u00e5r p\u00e5 bussen. Ho blir flau, veit at dei eigentleg gjer narr av henne. Dei fleste p\u00e5 hennar alder veit kven pappa er, og ho f\u00e5r sjeldan sjanse til \u00e5 gjere fyrsteinntrykk p\u00e5 nokon. Slik kjennest det ut, i alle fall. Tonje blir ein smule paranoid, redd for \u00e5 snakke med andre p\u00e5 sin alder.\n\nN\u00e5r eit s\u00e5 tydeleg bilete er teikna av henne i offentlegheita, korleis skal ho finne sin eigen identitet som vaksen?\n\nHo s\u00f8kjer mot sine kristne vener. Friminutta blir brukt til andakt og m\u00f8ter, p\u00e5 kveldane held dei vitnesbyrd for kvarandre. Tonje kan til d\u00f8mes halde opp ei appelsin for dei andre, og seie: \u00abDet hjelper ikkje \u00e5 halde frukta i handa og sj\u00e5 p\u00e5 ho. Det er berre ved \u00e5 smake p\u00e5 ho, at du verkeleg forst\u00e5r kor god ho er. Slik er det med Jesus. Ingen kan vite kor god han er, f\u00f8r dei trur p\u00e5 han.\u00bb\n\nI dei emosjonelle ten\u00e5ra blir det \u00e5 verkeleg kjenne Gud, \u00e5 h\u00f8yre stemma hans, eit m\u00e5l som skal ta n\u00e6rmast all tid og krefter. Hennar ungdomsoppr\u00f8r beveger seg ikkje bort fr\u00e5 kristendommen, men inn mot han; til leirar med den kristne organisasjonen Ungdom i Oppdrag. Fr\u00e5 ho er 15 \u00e5r fram til ho er 18 \u00e5r deltar ho p\u00e5 fleire slike leirar. Blant kjerneverdiane deira finn Tonje det ho lengtar etter: \u00c5 h\u00f8yre Guds stemme. N\u00e6rleiken til Gud blir viktig for \u00e5 f\u00e5 innpass i milj\u00f8et. Ho vil bli ein \u00abJesus freak\u00bb, som det kristne rockebandet DC Talk syng om p\u00e5 eit teppe av grungegitarar. Eller \u00abein Guds ord fanatikar\u00bb, som ho hugsar at dei song om p\u00e5 leir.\n\n\u2013 Eg valde \u00e5 tru heilt bokstaveleg p\u00e5 alt som stod i Bibelen, og \u00e5 vere radikal. Eg trudde det var det som m\u00e5tte til for \u00e5 endeleg f\u00e5 kjenne Gud. Men konsekvensen blei at Jesus-freakane var alt eg hadde. Difor blei det s\u00e5 avgjerande for meg \u00e5 bli sett som verdig i deira auge.\n\nTonje byter ut store genserar og dongeribukse med heimelaga batikklede, ho les heile Bibelen. Dei nye venene hennar knekk CD-ar med Michael Jackson i to. Alt for \u00e5 kome n\u00e6rmare Gud. Kva kan Tonje ofre for Jesus? Ho g\u00f8ymer unna teikneseriane. Svaret blir \u00e5 brenne ein gammal fantasy-favoritt, bokserien \u00abSagaen om isfolket\u00bb. Det svir i hjartet. For samtidig som Tonje gratulerer venene med \u00e5 ha f\u00e5tt s\u00e5kalla tungetale, Guds tale gjennom menneske, kjenner ho ingenting sj\u00f8lv. Ho ser p\u00e5 seg sj\u00f8lv som eit stort tomt hol som Gud ikkje vil snakke med. Om ho ikkje er den kristne kjendisdottera, kven er ho d\u00e5?\n\nTvilen har byrja \u00e5 melde seg. Men ho gir ikkje opp Gud heilt enno.\n\nEin dag p\u00e5 leir f\u00e5r Tonje beskjed fr\u00e5 ein leiar om at det er hennar tur til \u00e5 ta imot tungetalen. Inni henne er det kaos. Ho er stressa, redd, men t\u00f8r ikkje anna enn \u00e5 takke ja.\n\n\u2013 Eg var redd for at eg endeleg skulle f\u00e5 bevis p\u00e5 at Gud ville snakke med meg. For gjorde eg det, s\u00e5 m\u00e5tte eg tru p\u00e5 han. Og ville eg eigentleg det? Hadde eg ikkje i utgangspunktet kj\u00f8pt denne pakken fordi eg elska familien min?\n\nMen det er stilt. Heilt stilt. Tonje h\u00f8yrer framleis ingen Gud. Ho pr\u00f8var \u00e5 finne orda som Han skal ha sendt henne, men det verkar ikkje. Pr\u00f8var \u00e5 gjere leiaren stolt av henne. For han veit jo best? Ikkje sant?\n\nTonje opplever ikkje at Guds ord blir planta i ho den dagen. Orda er ikkje der. Ho f\u00e5r ikkje noko guddommeleg nytt spr\u00e5k, ingen tungetale.\n\n\u2013 Eg blei berre flau og skamfull. Igjen. For det var nokre andre p\u00e5 leiren som s\u00e5g meg, der eg pr\u00f8vde \u00e5 finne ord i meg som ikkje fanst. Og dei blei spydige.\n\nTonje oppdagar at det er ein samanheng, eit m\u00f8nster som ho enno ikkje rasjonelt klarer \u00e5 gripe, men som kjenslene hennar byrjar \u00e5 ta innover seg.\n\n\u2013 Eg kunne ikkje fortsette mitt andelege liv med \u00e5 tilfredsstille forventningar menn rundt meg hadde. Eg m\u00e5tte finne min eigen veg. Denne kjenslemessige erkjenninga tok eg vare p\u00e5 i hjartet mitt. Og hjartet mitt hadde vendt seg bort fr\u00e5 Gud.\n\nTonje Tornes, 39 \u00e5r\n\nDet er ikkje lenge til Tonje Tornes fyller 40 \u00e5r. P\u00e5 kafeen i Oslo har ho nettopp henta seg p\u00e5fyll av kaffi, p\u00e5 bordet ligg teikneserien \u00abLunch\u00bb, som ho sj\u00f8lv er redakt\u00f8r for.\n\nDen mislukka tungetaleopplevinga blei byrjinga p\u00e5 slutten av gudstrua. Etter mykje grubling og eitt \u00e5r p\u00e5 folkeh\u00f8gskule, i nytt milj\u00f8, klarte ho ikkje lenger \u00e5 seie at ho var kristen. I dag kallar ho seg agnostikar, usikker p\u00e5 om det finst noko st\u00f8rre der ute.\n\n\u2013 Eg har vore ein offentleg person som har sagt til heile landet at eg er kristen. Og d\u00e5 er det kanskje greitt \u00e5 seie no at eg ikkje er kristen. For \u00e5 fortelje at ting endrar seg \u2013 og det skal ein ikkje alltid vere redd for, eller ha d\u00e5rleg samvit for.\n\nFamilien har ho framleis god kontakt med, og ho trur at det var fellesskapet med dei som gav henne tryggleik, ikkje Gud.\n\n\u2013 Eg elskar foreldra mine, og det er ingen store s\u00e5r i v\u00e5r familie. Tvert om, det er mange gode minner. Sj\u00f8lvsagt kostar det \u00e5 ikkje dele deira tru, men eg er sikker p\u00e5 at kj\u00e6rleiken mellom oss toler det.\n\nTonje tok namnet til mor si som 20-\u00e5ring. B\u00e5de for \u00e5 sleppe at gamle bilete dukka opp heile tida, og av feministiske grunnar. Foto: Maren Kvamme Hagen / NRK\n\nSom eit ledd i \u00e5 finne ein eigen identitet tok Tonje etternamnet til mor si. No dukkar ikkje bilete av \u00ablille Tonje\u00bb opp ved kvart netts\u00f8k. Likevel har ikkje Tonje sterke negative kjensler rundt det \u00e5 ha st\u00e5tt p\u00e5 scena som liten.\n\n\u2013 Det var mitt liv. Skulle eg mislikt kvar eg kom fr\u00e5, s\u00e5 ville det bety at eg ogs\u00e5 mislikte meg sj\u00f8lv. Og det er eg ferdig med. Eg har mi erfaring, ei erfaring eg f\u00f8ler har gjort meg rik. Dessutan har ho gjort meg uredd.\n\nTonje har to s\u00f8ner, \u00abbegge ganske opptatt av Gud\u00bb. Dei kan finne p\u00e5 \u00e5 sp\u00f8rje henne:\n\n\u2013 Mamma, kva er vi? Er vi kristne?\n\nTonje svarar at dei er ein familie.\n\n\u2013 Du kan tru p\u00e5 det du vil og eg kan tru p\u00e5 det eg vil. Vi er uansett ein familie.\n\nNRK har vore i kontakt med Ungdom i Oppdrag for ein kommentar til denne artikkelen.

Trump lovet i valgkampen at han ikke ville kutte i de sosiale programmene for fattige og eldre, Medicaid og Medicare. I virkeligheten er det nettopp det som er i ferd med \u00e5 skje.\n\nHer er noen av hovedpunktene fra Senatets forslag :\n\nObama-administrasjonens program for utvidelse av Medicaid til \u00e5 omfatte nye lavinntektsgrupper blir avviklet, men Senatets forslag venter ett \u00e5r ekstra, til 2021, f\u00f8r nedtrapping av den f\u00f8derale st\u00f8tten starter. Medicaid er helseprogrammet for fattige og handikappede.\n\nDelstatene overtar gradvis st\u00f8rre ansvar for finansiering av Medicaid, parallelt med at f\u00f8deral st\u00f8tte f\u00e5r et tak per hode. En slik grense finnes ikke i dag.\n\nDelstatene kan tillate forsikringsselskapene \u00e5 kutte ut tilbud som i dag er en obligatorisk del av minimumsforsikringen. Det gjelder blant annet behandling for rusmisbruk, mentale lidelser og f\u00f8dselskontroll.\n\nEldre over 64 \u00e5r m\u00e5 betale opptil fem ganger mer i premie enn en 18-\u00e5ring. Det er republikanerne i begge kamrene enige om.\n\nOffentlig st\u00f8tte til Planned Parenthood kuttes helt i 1 \u00e5r. Institusjonen tilbyr familieplanlegging, prevensjon og abort. President Donald Trump har flere ganger snakket om at helsereformen m\u00e5 ha \"hjerte\", senest under folkem\u00f8tet i Cedar Rapids, Iowa onsdag. Foto: SCOTT OLSON / AFP\n\nDette er nytt\n\nP\u00e5 noen punkter har republikanerne i Senatet valgt \u00e5 beholde mer fra \u00abObamacare\u00bb, som er det folkelige navnet p\u00e5 Obama-administrasjonens helsereform \u00abAffordable Care Act\u00bb fra 2010:\n\nFattige amerikanere som ikke er forsikret gjennom jobben, skal fortsatt f\u00e5 statlige subsidier for \u00e5 kunne kj\u00f8pe helseforsikring. De som ikke er omfattet av Medicaid, og som tjener under 400 prosent av den f\u00f8derale fattigdomsgrensen, betaler i dag ikke skatt for de pengene som brukes p\u00e5 helseforsikring. Det vil republikanerne i Senatet redusere til 350 prosent av fattigdomsgrensen, mens kollegene i Huset ville kutte ut inntekt som grunnlag for behovspr\u00f8ving og bruke alder i stedet.\n\nForsikringsselskapene skal ikke kunne kreve h\u00f8yere premier fra folk med kroniske sykdommer, eller folk som tidligere har v\u00e6rt alvorlig syke.\n\nF\u00f8derale myndigheter forlenger ordningen med subsidier til forsikringsselskapene for rabatter de gir til de pasientene som har aller lavest inntekt.\n\nLes ogs\u00e5: Vinnere og tapere med Trumps helsereform\n\nM\u00e5 tilfredsstille b\u00e5de konservative og moderate\n\nFlertallsleder Mitch McConnell kan ikke hvile f\u00f8r han har f\u00e5tt flertall blant sine egne i Senatet for forslaget.

Men senator Ted Cruz sa i en kommentar til CNN denne uken at premiene ikke er lave nok. Han vil \u00e5pne for at samtlige minimumskrav til hva forsikringer skal inneholde, fjernes, gitt at det enkelte forsikringsselskap ogs\u00e5 tilbyr mer omfattende pakker.\n\nBlant moderate republikanere er det flere som er engstelige for nedtrappingen av st\u00f8tten til Medicaid. Blant andre gjelder det politikere fra delstatene Ohio og Vest-Virginia, der penger fra Obama-administrasjonens utvidelse av Medicaid har v\u00e6rt brukt i kampen mot narkotikaepidemien. De misliker ogs\u00e5 at fattige amerikanere ikke skal kunne bruke skattesubsidier til \u00e5 kj\u00f8pe forsikringer som inneholder st\u00f8tte til abort.\n\nI Lucas kommune, Ohio, bruker politiet penger fra Medicaid til \u00e5 rehabilitere narkomane.

Beregningen var gjort med utgangspunkt i reformforslaget fra Representantenes hus. Neste uke er det ventet at CBO kommer med beregningene for Senatets forslag. Det er ventet at tallet blir litt lavere, men ikke vesensforskjellig.\n\nDet skremmer mange folkevalgte, s\u00e6rlig i Representantenes hus, der det er flere som skal gjenvelges fra distrikt med reell konkurranse fra demokrater.\n\nVil Trump gripe inn?\n\nI sju \u00e5r har kampen mot president Obamas helseforsikringsreform v\u00e6rt hovedsaken i det republikanske partiet. Det vil v\u00e6re et nederlag av historiske dimensjoner om indre uenighet blant 52 folkevalgte republikanere i Senatet setter punktum for planene om \u00e5 reversere Obamacare.\n\nFlertallsleder Mitch McConnell \u00f8nsker \u00e5 stemme over forslaget i neste uke, f\u00f8r Senatet tar fri i forbindelse med nasjonaldagen 4. juli.
